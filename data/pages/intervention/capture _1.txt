While drones are dramatically faster than traditional surveying methods, they’re not necessarily the easiest tool to use.Flying a drone at a construction site isn’t always simple. Legal and logistical requirements must be navigated before you can get the data you need.But your best tool for capturing aerial images may already be on-site.Cranes are often one of the first pieces of equipment on-site, and they have a birds-eye view of your project. Pix4D’s Crane Camera solution, developed in collaboration with Liebherr, captures aerial images daily without a drone or any other aircraft.It’s designed to fit seamlessly into your existing workflow – without affecting the operating of the crane in any way. Powered by the crane, the Crane Camera solution works independently of a crane operator, automatically capturing images, uploading them, and processing them in the Cloud without any intervention from your team. The up-to-the-minute results can be reviewed from anywhere on the Pix4Dbim cloud platform.Webinar on demandIn a recent webinar, Pix4D, Liebherr and Losinger Marazzi (a branch of Bouygues Construction), teamed up to present the Crane Camera solution and explain how they use it on a daily basis to rapidly visualize the as-built situation, update project teams, check as-built vs. as-designed plans, document site progress, and verify the project schedule.Key learnings from the webinar include:How the Crane Camera solution works – and why it’s a viable alternative to drone mapping.What deliverables you can get with the Crane Camera.How to use and integrate the deliverables into your construction/BIM workflow.How to easily implement and test the solution on site.View a recording of the webinarLearn more about the Pix4D Crane CameraAutomated site visualization and documentation.Learn moreFAQRelated articlesPaving the way with automated as-built reports For many construction firms, there is simply no way to avoid rework.
