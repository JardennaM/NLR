Posted May 26, 2019 by Fintan Corrigan
Lidar sensors on UAVs capture imagery which only a few years ago needed an aircraft carrying large heavy lidar sensors and a crew to accomplish.Here, we look at 12 of the best lidar sensors for drones along with the best lidar drones.We feature lidar sensors from manufacturers such as Velodyne, Routescene, Leddartech, Riegl, YellowScan, Leica and Geodetics.The lidar drones include quadcopters, fixed wing drones, UAV helicopters from manufacturers such as DJI, Harris, Velos, Vulcan, OnyxStar and many more.A lidar sensor mounted on a UAV, along with the lidar software can process images very quickly in the cloud, allowing for effective decisions to be made by stakeholders and relevant parties.The output from these lidar drones and sensors is outstanding.  The pace of development and improvement in the lidar sensors over the past few years has been tremendous and will continue with more entrants into this sector.

 Over the coming years, we are going to see most of the lidar sensor work moving from aircraft to lidar drones.In fact, all the manufacturers of the large lidar sensors for airplanes have developed smaller lidar sensors for drones.We start off this post with the lidar drones being used for the various sensors, followed by how lidar sensor technology works. Then, we look at the best lidar sensors for drones.  Along the way, we have some terrific lidar drone sensor videos.
We also discuss some of the many great uses of lidar technology and how each lidar sensor works well in the different sectors such as  mining, forestry, surveying, corridor mapping etc.There are so many terrific uses for drones including drones mounted with lidar sensors.  Here is an excellent article, which shows you all the many uses for drones to date.Lidar DronesHere is the list of the lidar drones being used to carry the most popular lidar sensors detailed below;DJI M600 Pro lidar quadcopterDraganflyer CommanderRiegl RiCopter Lidar UAV quadcopterHarris H4 Hybrid HE UAV quadcopterVulcanUAV Harrier Industrial multirotorVelosUAV helicopterRobota Eclipse fixed wing droneDJI Matrice 200 Series quadcopterOnyxStar Xena drone lidarOnyxStar Fox-C8 HD quadcopterGeoDrone X4L lidar quadcopterTron F9 VTOL fixed wing lidar droneBoreal long range fixed wing droneVapor 55 UAV helicopterThe DJI Matrice 600 and 600 Pro can be used to carry many different lidar sensors.  Many solutions require a lidar sensor and also another sensor such as RGB camera for photogrammetry or a multispectral sensor mounted on the drone to capture the images for the particular solution. So in choosing a drone, the payload capacity of both a lidar sensor and RGB camera needs to be taken into consideration.Lidar Drone Full Solution ProvidersIf you need a full lidar drone solution, then the below providers have packages and expertise to put a full solution together for you.DraganFly UASPhoenix Lidar SystemsLidarUSARiegl Laser Measurement SystemsXena OnyxScan Advanced Lidar SystemsAbout Lidar Sensor TechnologyLidar – Light Detection and Ranging or Lidar is a remote sensing technology where the environment is scanned with a pulsed laser beam and the reflection time of the signal from the object back to the detector is measured.The Time-of-Flight (ToF) reflection time measurement can be used over distances from one meter up to several kilometers. To increase the range of lidar systems, very short laser pulses in the invisible Near Infrared range are used. These enable a far higher laser power compared to continuous wave lasers, while still complying with eye safety requirements.During the scanning process, the lidar system will gather individual distance points within an aggregate of points, from which 3D images of the environment can be computed. The laser scanners deflect the laser beam using deflecting mirrors, which enable them to achieve very wide fields of vision (FoV).Most of the latest UAV lidar systems can rotate around their own axis and offer 360 degree visibility. Modern devices achieve very high data rates with over one million distance points per second.

 How Lidar Sensors Works In BriefEmission of a laser pulse.Record of the back scattered signal.Distance measurement (time of flight x speed of light).Retrieving plane position and altitude.Computation of precise echo position.UAV Lidar Sensor UsesLidar Sensors For Drone Collision AvoidanceWithin a lidar sensor, a number of independent elements are integrated into a single device and will generate critical ranging data for safe navigation along with precise positioning. Lidar sensors have obstacle detection capabilities over a wide field of view, which make them ideal as part of a sense and avoid solution.  Lidar is the leading technology for automobile collision avoidance and also in driver-less cars.Collision avoidance technology has now moved across into the consumer drone sector with the highly innovative DJI Mavic 2 (sensors on all sides), DJI Phantom 4 Pro (using 2 Ultrasound sensors  and 4 monocular sensors) and the Yuneec Typhoon H Pro (uses the Intel RealSense R200 3D camera) now with collision avoidance.Lidar Sensors For Ground And Above Ground ImageryThe latest lidar sensors have integrated optical altimeter technology which deliver accurate distance measurements above ground level while meeting size, weight and cost requirements of UAV manufacturers.Agriculture and forestry use lidar to inspect vegetation such as leaves and crops. Also, the above ground imagery (for example forest canopy) can be removed to view the ground surface area.Lidar Drones For Structural InspectionThe best lidar sensors  have powerful built-in signal processing, large field of view and multi-segment measurements which generate critical distance data and efficient obstacle detection, which enable safe navigation when performing structural inspections.Lidar Sensor At NightLidar sensors also described as laser scanning will work in low contrast or shadowy situations, even at night.

 Lidar UAV Uses In Brief Agriculture and forestry.Archaeology and cultural heritage documentation.Corridor mapping: power line, railway track, and pipeline inspection.Topography in open-cast mining.Construction site monitoring.Building and structural inspections.Surveying of urban environments.Resource management.Collision avoidance.Shoreline and storm surge modeling.Hydrodynamic modeling.Digital Elevation Models.Multispectral and Photogrammetry ImageryLidar, multispectral and photogrammetry imagery are all very closely related technologies.  In some sectors and situations, images from all 3 are required to give a full analysis of the terrain, vegetation or structure.  To read further on these technologies see the following articles:UAVs In The Lidar Applications Sector Increases SubstantiallyIntroduction To UAV Photogrammetry And Lidar Mapping BasicsMultispectral Imaging Drones In Farming Yield Big BenefitsMultispectral Remote Sensing Drones For Golf Course VitalityToF 3D Cameras (Flash Lidar)Now, sometimes you might hear people talk about Flash Lidar.  Time-of-Flight cameras sensors are often referred to as Flash Lidar. But there are big differences in LiDAR and Flash LiDAR technology and its uses.ToF flash lidar is scannerless, meaning that the entire scene is captured with a single light pulse, as opposed to point-by-point with a rotating laser beam.Time-of-flight flash lidar cameras capture a whole scene in three dimensions with a dedicated image sensor, and therefore has no need for moving parts.  ToF has so many great uses.  Here is a terrific article called “ToF flash lidar cameras and best uses” which gives you all the information on ToF flash lidar and it terrific uses.  The article includes some excellent knowledgeable videos on ToF flash lidar.
