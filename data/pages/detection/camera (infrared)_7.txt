UAV/Drone thermal imaging camera for gas detection – Workswell GIS-320









Under certain circumstances, infra-red cameras are highly suitable for detecting gas escapes and the presence of gas in the air. They can be also helpful during tests on improving environmental safety. A thermal camera can detect greenhouse gases in the air as well as gas leaks which may hazardous to the environment and can threaten human health.Some gases used in industry can significantly damage the environment and may cost a lot of money if they go unnoticed. Therefore, it is essential to eliminate any uncontrolled leaks.“Traditional” methods for detecting gases require direct contact between a probe and the gas with the use of sensor technology. These methods are restricted due the time required to get a reading from the sensor and the risk of non-detection due to the gas type or location of the leak (gases may leak to places other where the sensor is located). 
  
 To detect gases, Workswell company offers a specially constructed infra-red camera, which is able to visualise gas on the principle of infra-red thermography. The thermal camera provides a full image of the scanned area and gas leaks are reflected in the image as changes in the intensity of detected radiation. The Workswell GIS 320 (gas imaging system) thermal camera is the ideal solution to detect leaks of hazardous gasses via unmanned air vehicles (drones/UAV systems) as there are options to change image and camera setting such as, emissivity, gas intensity range, camera type, and more through standard RC transmitters connected to the CAN bus or PWM inputs. The thermal camera can also record measured data, including GPS coordinates and the wireless HDMI transfer of images to the pilot.

The Workswell GIS 320 thermal camera is a highly precise thermal camera with a sensitive, cooled quantum detector and a resolution 320×240 and with a precise temperature sensitivity of 15 mK, which also enables to detect gases in very small concentrations.
 Detected gases: Benzene, Ethanol, Ethylbenzene, Heptane, Hexane, Isoprene, Methanol, MEK, MIBK, Octane, Pentane, 1-Pentane, Toluene, Xylene, Butane, Ethane, Methane, Propane, Ethylene, Propylene plus hundreds of other hydrocarbons and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC).INQUIRY
