 Detect Drones with acoustic sensors

DRONE-DETECTOR is a compact and IP sensor that uses acoustic detection technology to detects any kind of electrical drone. It is able to detect drones without Radio Frequency links (when on auto-pilot) and that are invisible to radar (small and plastic drones).
 Create a sensing barrier to protect your perimeter

The DRONE DETECTOR can be deployed as a network of sensors to create a detection barrier. All modules are plug and play and are centrally controlled on a single management platform.
 STOP THE DRONE BY FIRING A JAMMER

Each sensor can easily be used as a self jammer/spoofer controller and drastically minimize spillover in time and space
