Perimeter Surveillance Radars   ►




Drone Surveillance Radars
“Anti-Drone” is an innovative complex UAV detection and neutralization system, that includes all the necessary equipment to detect, identify, track and neutralize threats resulting from unauthorized penetration of drones into protected zones.
The main component of the integrated "Anti-Drone" system is the drone detection radar, which assures accurate and reliable detection, identification and tracking of drones, RCI aircrafts, copters, quadcopters, helicopters, etc. crossing the perimeter of secure facilities.
Our company provides customized anti-UAV systems with different models of UAV detection radars. Our anti-drone radars have different technical specifications and performance characteristics, which helps us to integrate the most suitable counter-drone radar into the “Anti-Drone” system and meet even the most demanding requirements of our customers.
The choice of the most appropriate drone surveillance radar will depend on many aspects, including the detection range requirements and the location, size and type of the facility that has to be protected (industrial facilities, airports, public venues, border monitoring areas, strategic installation, etc.).
Our Anti-UAV defence systems can be equipped with the following drone surveillance radar systems:

GROK Drone Detection Radar
GROK drone surveillance radar provides automatic detection and tracking of multiple UAVs and is available in two versions: GROK Ku-band UAV detection radar and GROK X-band UAV detection radar with detection range of 2-4 km for micro UAVs.
