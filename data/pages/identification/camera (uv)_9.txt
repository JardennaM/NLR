Ofil DayCor® ROMPact Block Corona Camera Module Details
The Ofil DayCor® ROMPact Block Corona Camera Module is a solar blind, bi-spectral, UV-visible, block camera optimised for the detection of corona in high and medium voltage electrical installations. It can be attached to various systems such as UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles) and helicopters.
The Ofil DayCor® ROMPact Block Corona Camera Module’s design ensures that it can be easily attached to, and detached from, fixed mounts, moving pans and tilts. It may be connected to gimbals and standard 0.25-inch thread tripod mounts.
This unit's stabilizing plate ensures that the camera can be kept steady by the payload’s stabilization system thereby facilitating the capture of smooth footage. Moreover, the inclusion of a stabilising plate, coupled with the camera’s robust housing, makes it suitable for use in challenging environments.
The Ofil DayCor® ROMPact Block Corona Camera Module’s physical design makes it ideal for airborne inspections, whilst its DayCor® solar blind technology provides the instrument with high sensitivity to UVc radiation, ensuring that it is able to detect corona and arcing from afar. Together these features ensure that the camera is suitable for high-speed, corona detection applications.  It is able to produce smooth combined UV and visible footage which clearly indicates corona whilst blocking noise and false signals, allowing the user to locate electrical faults accurately.
Footage captured using the Ofil DayCor® ROMPact Block Corona Camera Module is transmitted, in real-time, to a remote monitor, providing a up-to-the-minute view of the electrical installation. In addition to streaming footage, the Ofil DayCor® ROMPact Block Corona Camera Module can save selected media to its integrated flashcard and will record a numerical value for the number of corona events encountered over the course of a measurement period.
Further to this, the Ofil DayCor® ROMPact Block Corona Camera Module can be used with a variety of other imagers, such as IR cameras, and its lightweight, compact design means that it can be integrated into multi-spectral systems.
Adding to the Ofil DayCor® ROMPact Block Corona Camera Module’s adaptability is its choice of control options. The user can operate this instrument using a wired remote control, which issues RS232 communication commands, alternatively, he/she may utilise a wireless remote control and Wi-Fi.
The Ofil DayCor® ROMPact Block Corona Camera Module is a versatile, adaptable camera, ideal for accurately identifying and locating corona within high and medium voltage systems.
