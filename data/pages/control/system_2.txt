Flight Control System Description














	1.   System Overview.   A typical UAV Navigation (UAVN) Flight Control System (FCS) consists of:

	 

				 

Component

Provided By

Onboard Elements


						Autopilot



						UAV Navigation:

VECTOR




						Datalink



						UAV Navigation:

								900 MHz Datalink (TELEM05)


						External supplier: RS-232/ETH capable

	2.   Standard Setup: This configuration uses the VECTOR autopilot, a Joystick, an external radio (not supplied by UAVN), GCS03-NR and Visionair software.

	 


 

	3.   UAVN's APs are complete APs; they include an Air Data System (ADS - static and dynamic pressure gauges) and a GPS, both connected to an Internal Measurement System that contains accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers and an internal CPU. These systems are connected to a flight control computer that implements aircraft control and communications with the GCS via a datalink and payload control.The schematic of a typical UAVN AP is as follows (VECTOR example):



	 

	 

	4.   AP Navigation Control System Logic: the AP flies the aircraft in fully autonomous mode, from take-off to landing. Its Flight Plan Management (FPM) module will calculate the trajectory to guide the aircraft to the next waypoint (WP), and the FCS module will use the information provided by the Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS) to steer the aircraft in the desired trajectory. The following diagram explains the logic behind the navigation control system:

	 



	 

	5.   Flight Modes: in the Knowledge Base article 'Basic AP Operating Modes' (Fixed Wing and Rotary Wing) a table with the main Autopilot Flight Modes is displayed. The principal flight control modes are:

		TAKE-OFF: Fixed Wing and Rotary Wing

		AUTO: Fixed Wing and Rotary Wing

		FLY-TO: Fixed Wing and Rotary Wing

		LAND: Fixed Wing and Rotary Wing

HOLD (Fixed Wing) - HOVER (Rotary Wing)

MANUAL

		SAFE: Fixed Wing and Rotary Wing
