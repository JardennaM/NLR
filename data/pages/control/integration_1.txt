CONTROLLING
THE SKIES 

Aerial security and surveillance, mitigating aerial threats to assets, corporate infrastructure and public safety. 

THE THREAT 

THE SOLUTION 

 


 


Aerial Forensic Analysis and ReportingOur forensic drone experts are able to interrogate drone on board systems revealing GPS locations, recorded flights, purpose of use, origin of parts and ID of operator.
Aerial Security and SurveillanceFaster and more flexible than traditional methods, our drones are highly effective, cost-efficient security and surveillance solutions which are not limited by physical barriers.
Integration of Counter MeasuresOur counter-drone technology detects, tracks and/or interacts with rogue drones in order to protect public privacy, security, safety or critical infrastructure.
WHO WE ARE & WHAT WE DO


At DroneControl we are a team of professionally qualified drone pilots, each skilled at night and beyond line of site operation and experienced across counter terrorism, corporate, crime prevention, military and disaster area evaluation sectors..
Our pilots use custom tools and techniques to identify model attack opportunities and provide aerial security. Our security experts also forensically analyse rogue drones that have been neutralised and captured, protecting our clients against present and future threats.

Drones are part of our everyday lives; easily available to buy with an estimated 10 million drones shipped globally in 2017 alone and with self-flying capabilities. In the hands of responsible pilots the risk from drones is minimal. However the nature and capabilities of modern day drones means that organisations and individuals can be at significant risk from drone crime.
There is no current legal requirement to register drones and increasing numbers of drones are being seized by law enforcements due to involvement in illegal activities such as drug smuggling, terrorist bombing or illegal surveillance.


PRIVACYDrones can attack Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and other wireless connections.
CONTRABANDDrones are used to smuggle drugs, weapons and phones in to prisons.
INFRASTRUCTUREDrones have the capability to act as an aerial platform to attack infrastructure.
 AVIATIONDrones in the same airspace as commercial aircrafts create potential for catastrophe

Counter drone technology can detect, identify, neutralize and retain rogue drones. We are able to detect rogue drones approaching protected, private or restricted airspace and mitigating the imminent potential threat using continuous perimeter testing.
We work with you to identify the risks to your airspace and to seamlessly integrate rogue drone mitigation and detection solutions in to you current security and privacy measures.
We understand the approaches that provide aerial security, drone defence and perimeter security and can support you by neutralising and forensically analysing captured drones to support potential prosecution.


DETECTDrones can be detected optically, acoustically or by scanning radio frequencies.
IDENTIFYDrone DNA can be identified using advanced signal intelligence technology.
 NEUTRALIZE DroneControl partners with the leading manufacturers of countermeasure technology.
RETAINDrone computers can be disassembled, interrogated and forensically analysed.
