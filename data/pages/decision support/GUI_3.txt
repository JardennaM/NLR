Memar Ehsan Tarkesh EsfahaniIn a mixed human-robot team, adaptive automation methods can be used based on mental and cognitive states of human operators. Such adaptive behaviors can be designed such that lead to mitigation of human errors and consequently improvement of the task performance. However, real-time estimation of human internal states and their effects on the task...ViewSimilar publications     Minimal oscillating subnetwork in the Huang-Ferrell model of the MAPK cascadeArticleFull-text availableJun 2017 Otto Hadač František Muzika Vladislav Nevoral[...] Igor SchreiberPrompted by the recent growing evidence of oscillatory behavior involving MAPK cascades we present a systematic approach of analyzing models and elucidating the nature of biochemical oscillations based on reaction network theory.

Examples include real-time posture analysis using a camera [112] for ergonomics training to prevent fatigue, and sensor-based observation of personnel location and activity for safety and performance evaluation goals [113,114,115,116,117].  ...Application of Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in Advanced Human Health and Safety Surveillance: A Data Fusion and Machine Learning ApproachThesisFull-text availableFeb 2019 Amir BaghdadiAccurate and reliable quantification of human physical and physiological state using wearable sensing devices is paramount in health monitoring and safety surveillance, which necessitates the measurement of relevant signals from various on-body spots. The unobtrusiveness and economic considerations urge data fusion techniques to provide proper estimations to eliminate the sensors with lower observational power and significance in body status representation. The data of the main sensing unit need to be predictive for the in-control and out-of-control physical states of a human. This significant predictive power enables us to develop the proper monitoring systems for the prediction of critical states prior to any potential safety and health incident. The present Ph.D. dissertation attempted to establish a stepping stone for the development of such a framework. In this regard, Kalman filter was employed to estimate the hip acceleration and trunk posture from a posteriori data of a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) at the ankle and a priori information from Fourier series approximation to relate body kinematics considering the periodic nature of gait. Using the ankle IMU data alone, support vector machine (SVM) classification of the kinematic profile features derived by a template matching pattern recognition technique ($1 Recognizer) was applied on the gait strides segmented through a novel stepwise search-based segmentation algorithm. A non-parametric agglomerative method for multivariate change point detection and time series pattern analysis was examined on the stride trajectory features across a prolonged daily occupational task. The research outcomes for 20 subjects suggested the error rates of 6.5% and 3.12% for hip acceleration and trunk posture estimations, respectively. The single sensor fatigue classification showed 90% accuracy utilizing gait stride features. The prolonged gait monitoring scheme presented promising results in early detection and prevention of fatigue based on the subjective declarations for 15 recruited participants. These research studies proposed a framework for safety surveillance and fatigue monitoring to prevent safety incidents utilizing a minimal set of sensors and data that can be extended to other movement monitoring application in healthcare through the ordinary smart wearable devices.View... Drone dynamics and corresponding low-level controllers are also implemented in the simulation environment such that each drone can fly in either stabilized manual or autonomous mode by tracking point-to-point trajectories. The details of the developed interactive simulation environment can be found in [36]. Furthermore, a graphical user interface (GUI) is developed to enable users to interact with the robotic drones for the tele-exploration task of this study.  ...Physiological Measures for Human Performance Analysis in Human-Robot Teamwork: Case of Tele-ExplorationArticleFull-text availableJan 2018 Amirhossein H. Memar Ehsan T. EsfahaniContinuous monitoring of mental workload and situation awareness in operational environments are useful for understanding and prediction of human performance. Such information can be used to develop real-time adaptive systems to enhance human performance. In this paper, we investigate the use of workload- and attention-related physiological measures to predict operator performance and situation awareness in the context of tele-exploration with a small team of robots. A user study is conducted based on a simulated scenario involving visual scanning and manual control tasks with varying levels of taskload. Brain activity and eye movements of the participants are monitored across the experimental tasks using electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye tracker sensors. The performances of the subjects are evaluated in terms of target detection and situation awareness (primary metrics) as well as reaction time and false detection (secondary metrics). Moreover, individual differences in two specific visual skills, visual search (VS) and multi-object tracking (MOT), are considered as between-subject factors in the experimental design. The main effects of task type and individual differences reveal that VS andMOT skill have significant effects on target detection and situation awareness, respectively. The correlations of physiological measures with the task performance and situation awareness are analyzed. The results suggest that brain-based features (mental workload and distraction) which represent the covert aspect of attention are better suited to predict the secondary performance metrics. On the other hand, glance based features which represent the overt aspect of attention, are shown to be the best predictors of the primary performance metrics.ViewGet access to 30 million figuresJoin ResearchGate to access over 30 million figures and 118+ million publications – all in one place.Join for freeJoin ResearchGate to find the people and research you need to help your work.15+ million members118+ million publications700k+ research projectsJoin for freeorDiscover by subject areaRecruit researchersJoin for freeLoginEmail Tip: Most researchers use their institutional email address as their ResearchGate loginPasswordForgot password?
