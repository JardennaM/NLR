ReWiLinkTM for UAVs -Safe operation and reliable wireless link


ReWiLink™ makes the link resilient ensuring its maintenance when conditions worsen

Safe operation of a drone requires a stable command and control link between the pilot on the ground and the flying drone. Conventional links will gradually deteriorate when the distance increases, making the link more vulnerable to interference and sudden condition changes, which in turn can compromise safe flying.
ReWiLink™ adds resilience to the command and control link, ensuring that the pilot maintains control of the drone at all times. In the face of unexpected worsening conditions, the pilot can initiate the necessary safety procedures, avoiding accidents. This is one of the reasons why choosing ReWiLink™ is the best choice. But how does ReWiLink™ work? Find out here
