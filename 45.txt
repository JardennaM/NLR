RF-Sensors: the cornerstone of complete airspace securityDedrone RF-Sensors detect drones and remote controls by their radio frequency (RF) signatures. Commercial, hobbyist, and homebrew drones are detected, including the entire DJI product line​.




RF-100OVERVIEW
The RF-100 detects and classifies drones via multiple, integrated software-defined radios (SDRs). Detection range can reach up to 1,5 kilometre, depending on installation and environment characteristics.
BEST FOR

Long-range detection and early-warning
Detects and classifies commercial and hobbyist drones
Built-in reporting identifies critical drone threats
Understanding how many drones intrude into the airspace
Early detection of drones, even before they take off
Classification of drone characteristics and incident logging













RF-300OVERVIEW
The RF-300 detects and classifies drones via multiple, integrated software-defined radios (SDRs). RF-Sensors detection range can reach up to 1 kilometre, depending on installation and environment characteristics.
BEST FOR

RF-based localization finds drones and pilots
Automatically tracks and plots flight and pilot position on map
Supplements RF-100 and video-based detection
Understanding how many drones intrude into the airspace
Early detection of drones, even before they take off
Classification of drone characteristics and incident logging
