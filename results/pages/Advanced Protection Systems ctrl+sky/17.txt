CTRL+SKY is a cutting-edge system for detection and neutralisation of drones entering a restricted airspace. CTRL+SKY is the only system in the world that takes advantage of:• Modular and fully configurable 3D radar sensor,• Radar tracking bases on MHT (Multi Hypothesis Tracking) algorithms• RF sensor that enables including any drone on the so-called white list• Fully integrated and automated directional or omnidirectional jammer for neutralisation of drones• MIMO radar technologies that help improve detection accuracy• Acoustic sensor that enables determining the direction from which the drones are approaching• Dedicated web application for controlling the system                                                                                                                                        RADAR                                                                                    Detect all the commercial and hobby drones.

Registration of incidents in an archive                                                                                                                                RF SENSOR                                                                                    Excellent availability. Very early warning of a drone appearing nearby. Excellent functioning, even in difficult urban areas. Detection of the drone and the control station (drone operator). Enables including any drone on the so-called white list. Unmatched quality of system functioning thanks to application of multi-sensor approach:• Operation in all kinds of weather conditions, both during the day and at night• Best price to quality ratio on the market• Possibility of purchasing or leasing the system• Detection of autonomous drones (with deactivated RF communication)• Accurate determination of drone position and speed                                                                                                                                        STATIONARY SYSTEM                                                                                    The stationary system is intended for permanent protection of a given area. In contrast to the mobile version, the structure of Ctrl+Sky Stationary is based on a high stable mast installed at the location that is optimal for correct functioning of the system. In the stationary version there are applied different camera types depending on the needs of the recipient. There can also be employed the cameras that are already present within a given infrastructure. Ctrl+Sky Stationary is also equipped with a box server intended for processing data and managing the whole system, making sure that the data coming from individual sensors is combined. The box server can be located within the distance of even up to 100 metres from the mast.

It is intended for protecting mass events, borders and other open spaces from improper or criminal use of drones, both during the day and at night, in any weather conditions. The system ensures the so-called umbrella protection, without any dead zones, and enables efficient detection of even small drones within the distance of even up to 2000 metres, while at the same time minimising the number of false alarms.

Instead of using a mast, the system is installed with the use of a lightweight and functional tripod. Thanks to that, Ctrl+Sky Portable is able to protect selected areas during a specific, limited time, e.g. during special events and gatherings, such as marathons, parades and election rallies. Ctrl+Sky Portable is fitted with a so-called “battery pack”, enabling temporary power supply to the system in the event of lack of access to a power grid.

It enables direct neutralisation of intrusive drones by intercepting them and forcing them to land immediately. The jammer works by jamming the communication channels within the 2400 – 2483.5 MHz and 5725 – 5875 MHz bands and the GPS navigation of drones within the 1559 – 1610 MHz band. The devices that we offer has been fitted with directional antennas with circular polarisation and 3dB beam width of 15 degrees. The jammer works with the output power of 0.5 W for the GPS band and 3 W for the 2.4 and 5.8 GHz bands. The efficient range of the jammer is as much as 1000 m. The device is available both in stationary version and in a handy portable version operated similarly to traditional aimed weapons. Both versions enable jamming the radio transmissions between the drone and its operator, as well as jamming the GPS/GLONASS/Galileo signal. 2018 TerraHexen. All rights reserved.
