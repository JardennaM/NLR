We have become accustomed to ever-present cameras in public spaces and are perpetually under some kind of surveillance, however private houses and premises were, until recently, under total control of their owners and who enjoyed relative security and freedom from intruders. Unfortunately, the misuse of drones is also a threat on private property. Drones equipped with cameras or eavesdropping capabilities are a danger to our privacy and security. Drones have become increasingly affordable and accessible. Their mobility and difficulty of detection allow them to enter areas previously deemed safe and well-protected such as government buildings and federal institutions. The hostile use of drones can jeopardise areas particularly sensitive to spying, hacking, carrying a physical threat to employees, stealing of sensitive data and causing many other undesirable events. Airports and surrounding areas are particularly vulnerable to intrusions of drones. Australian senator Barry O’Sullivan, former air crash investigator, said that drones in the vicinity of planes are a  “catastrophe is waiting to happen”. Without ability to detect and gain control over drones, security of airports will be compromised, and delayed flights, air traffic paralysis or in the worst cases plane crashes will become a grim reality. Prisons are another facilities where misuse of drones can pose significant dangers. Illegal delivery of weapons, drugs, cell phones and smuggling of contraband are just some of the issues prisons need to face. The penitentiary system, in the absence of protection against drones, virtually loses the ability to to maintaining the highest standard of security. Stadiums, which can hold tens of thousands of people, are a potential target of hostile drones. The gathering of many people in a relatively small area makes stadiums easy targets for terrorists. Using a drone is especially tempting taking into account the reinforced security at the traditional entrance gates. Recently, at an interstate game, an intrusive drone contributed to provoking riots among the dedicated fans by transporting a flag from one side to the other. It’s easy to imagine how tragic the effects of using a drone as a weapon could be, causing hundreds if not thousands of casualties and triggering uncontrollable panic among spectators. Special protection against hostile use of drones is required at critical infrastructure facilities, such as power plants, utilities, dams, bridges, or telecommunication networks, which, if damaged can jeopardise the day to day operations or in worst case scenario, create casualties among the population. Intrusive Unmanned Aerial Systems can directly threaten these facilities, by using explosives or spying with the intent of industrial espionage, which can be used in hostile activities. Mass public events such as concerts, demonstrations, marathons and parades are occasions that require special protection and security. Wherever we deal with large groups which have assembled for a specific purpose, hostile use of drones can cause enormous risks. In the worst case, drones can contribute to causing numerous deaths through the dispatch of hazardous materials. It is important to realise that standard security for public events, in the form of regular military units, police or security firms, is not enough. An attack from the sky is as likely today as any other previously known danger. U-space is the European Commission’s vision for the safe, secure and efficient handling of drone traffic and a key enabler for the growing drone market to generate economic and societal benefits. To create a situation awareness capability and to allow safe BVLOS (beyond visual line of sight) operation of drones, U-space systems will ingest data from a range of sensors, including a portable ground-based radar system such as Ctrl+Sky Radar. contactGet in touch with our offices in Poland and the USA.
