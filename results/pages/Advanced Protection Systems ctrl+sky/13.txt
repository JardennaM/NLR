drone detection and neutralization systemResponse to growing market needsDemand for non-military counter-drone systems is driven by:the sudden growthof the unregulated drone market is causing more frequent threats related to hostile / unwanted use of dronesan increase in the number of potentially harmful incidents and accidents involving drones,especially in public spaces  increased interest and recorded casesof drones beingused by criminal groups and terrorists growing awareness  of governmentsand federal institutions of potential threats from drones used  by hostile actorsCtrl+Sky is a unique multi-sensor counter-drone system that is able to detect, track and neutralize intrusive unmanned aerial systems. It is exceptionally effective because it is based on patented APS technologies and multi-sensor approach: from the software to the hardware. Why Ctrl+Sky has many competitive advantages which makes it the most advanced product on the market. From the complete multi-sensor configuration of the system, the price-performance ratio,to the patented, unique sensors. Combining scientific approach with practical application and focusing on maximizing efficiency make Ctrl+Sky a global market leader in its category. The world’s only drone detection system using:•  Modular and fully reconfigurable radar sensor• MIMO radar technologies for improved detection accuracy• Radar tracking based on MHT (multi hypothesis tracking) algorithms• Acoustic sensor to determine the direction of incoming dronesCTRL+SKY STATIONARY •  Multi-sensor drone detection, identification and neutralization system •  Integrated radar, acoustic, RF and vision sensors, as well as jammers •  Modular and scalable design to protect effectively installations/areas of any size•  Robust design to withstand any weather conditions with flexible mounting optionsCTRL+SKY PORTABLE •  Portable, multi-sensor drone detection, identification and neutralization system•  Integrated radar, acoustic, RF and vision sensors, as well as jammers•  Power supply from the battery or generator allows for 24 hours non-stop operation•  Mounting all the sensors on tripods provides mobility and allows quick installation of the system in the areas of interestCTRL+SKY MOBILE •  Multi-sensor drone detection, identification and neutralization system mounted on scissor lift on pickup •  Integrated radar, RF and vision sensors, as well as jammer•  Neutralization in manual or automatic mode by jamming its remote control and positioning systems (all currently functional global navigation satellite systems (GNSS): GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou)•  Mobility, availability and operational stand-by in just a few minutes to provide effective protection as a result•  Tandem power supply from accumulators or generator to ensure any long and autonomous operation of the system•  Operating from the internal control panelCTRL+SKY CyView Dedicated, web-based application with an intuitiveand user-friendly interface allowing to provide secureaccess for a defined users group from a PC, laptopor a mobile device. •  Monitoring a defined airspace•  Definition of protected area•  Scalable, multi-module system•  Integration of radar, acoustic, vision and RF sensors •  Real-time event preview on OpenStreetMap or Google Maps•  Indication of drone direction, height and speed•  Tracking many targets to detect drone swarms•  Archiving incidents data•  SMS, email and system alerts•  Open API for integration •  Optional integration with automated jammer and communication neutralizerFunctionalityFunctionalityRF sensor onlyAcoustic sensor onlyCtrl+Sky (multi-sensor)All-weather operationDetects drones with no RF signatureNon-line of sight detectionValue for moneyReliable operation in urban environmentsEnhanced performance due to multi-sensor data fusionCoverage of wide threat setSensor TypeBenefitsLimitations Detects ANY commercial or hobbyist drone All-weather operation Provides exact drone position  Extremely low false alarm rates   Flexible detection ranges (few meters to few km) AffordableRadar sensor  Requires line-of-sights (does not see thru) Does not require line-of-sight for acoustic signal Low cost Provides drone bearing   Drone vs non-drone signal classification  Extreme weather might have impact  Short-range (<200m)Acoustic sensor Low-cost  Freely available  Early-warning sensor (RF signal presence detection) Requires RF signal presence   Difficult to use in URBAN scenariosRF sensor Easily available Low cost Visual confirmation sensorVision cameras  Weather sensitive (problems with clouds, sun, etc) Short-range How it worksThanks to the multi-sensor approach, Ctrl+Sky enables efficient detection, identification  and neutralization of drones, day and night, in all weather conditions. Ctrl+Sky offers a scalable  multi-sensors approach to ensure a complete “dome” of protection from unwanted drone invasion. The combination of proprietary radar, acoustic, vision and RF sensors allows Ctrl+Sky to minimize false alarms and detects even small drones at distances up to 2000 meters. Video cameras register recordingsof detected drones, so it is possibleto present hard evidence of an intruderin a protected area. The FMCW radar sensor operates in the X band and uses MIMO technology to locate drones. Ctrl+Sky uses the mostadvanced radar tracker based on MHT algorithm. The system can  distinguish drones fromother flying objects, such as birds. Acoustic sensor is based on 8-element  microphone array that uses digital beam forming technique in the acoustic domain to accurately localize sound sources in 3D space. Advanced, machine learning based classification algorithms discriminate between drones and other objects. RF Sensor detects radio-link between a drone and remote control-station by identifying radio frequency (RF) signatures of Wi-Fi signals. By using multiple RF Sensors the droneoperator could also be localized. Ctrl+Sky Jammer – efficient and advanced radio transmission and navigation jammer –is an optional element of the System. It allows direct neutralization of intrusive drones by jamming its remote control and positioning systems. Its use is restricted to a group of customers with appropriate permissions. Unmatched system performance thanks to multi-sensor approach:Solutions •  Operation in all weather conditions, both day and night•  Detection of autonomous drones•  Detect drones with RF communication disabled•  Precise positioning of drones distances and directions•  The best price / quality ratio in the market•  Possibility of purchasing or leasing the systemCtrl+sky is a system for every entity that needs to control an airspace over the protected object. The potential use of such a system is very broadPrivatePropertyGovernmentAirportsPrisonsPublicEventsStadiumsCriticalInfrastructureU-spaceMonitoring    Advanced Protection Systems is a technology company that has developed and commercialized a  unique  system  for  identifying  and  neutralizing  drones:  Ctrl+Sky.
