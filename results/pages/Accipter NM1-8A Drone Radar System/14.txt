Leonardo Falcon Shield At DSEi 2015, Finmeccanica  Selex ES unveiled its Counter-Unmanned Air Vehicle (C-UAV) system, named Falcon Shield. Falcon Shield provides users with a multi-spectral threat sensing capability and, through the integration of an electronic attack capability, a multi-layered threat response. This response introduces a capability to take control of a remotely-piloted drone and land it safely (a command-link control intervention capability) prior to the need to defeat the threat by simple jamming or kinetic solutions. Consequently, the potential for undesired collateral effects is greatly minimised. Falcon Shield is derived from Selex ESs heritage associated with the provision of short-range defence solutions against a variety of airborne threats. Falcon Shield makes use of Selex ESs high-performance, passive electro-optical and electronic surveillance sensors, combined with scenario specific radar. These provide a fully integrated threat detection, identification and tracking capability which enables Falcon Shield to operate in environments that range from wide area through to high-clutter, urban canyons. Incorporated within the Falcon Shield system is Selex ESs electronic attack capability that provides users with the ability to disrupt or take control of the threat. Because Falcon Shield is inherently flexible, this electronic attack capability can be complemented by the integration of additional, optional kinetic effectors. Ease of use is provided through use of the Selex ES Vantage Command, Control & Situation Awareness (C2SA) framework. This delivers an intuitive user interface and automated threat detection & tracking functions, including automated handover between detection and identification sensors. http://www.leonardocompany.com/en http://www.leonardocompany.com/enhttp://www.leonardocompany.com/enCOUNTER UAS DIRECTORY  SEPTEMBER 2017  Liteye AUDS The AUDS Technology Team brings together three leading British companies each with the unique capabilities required to create AUDS.

This means the device is designed to interrupt the control of the drone by overwhelming the control frequency. This causes the drone to stop and hover, or return to the operator, depending upon the model of the drone. The drone operator has no control while the frequency is being overwhelmed with RF energy. The Dronebuster can take this one step further and also overwhelm the GPS signal, which will cause the drone to land or fall out of the sky. The Dronebuster is a cost effective tool for security teams and first responders to use during fluid, ambiguous, fast-paced encounters. The system allows security teams and law enforcement to efficiently deal with a drone approaching a Forward Operating Base, hovering over a large crowd, snooping into secure/private areas, or flying in restricted airspace. With the Dronebuster, the operator has the tools to intercept the drone command link and command the drone to descend or go home. All the operator must do is aim the Dronebuster at the drone and toggle the switch. The LE, or law enforcement model of the Dronebuster allows State and local law enforcement and first responders to clear nuisance drones without forcing them to land. This model will interfere with both communications and video downlinking protocols. It will not however, interfere with GPS navigation signals. In many cases, the drone will simply go home. For all non US Government entities: This device has not been authorized as required by the rules of the Federal Communications Commission. This device is not, and may not be, offered for sale or lease, or sold or leased, until authorization is obtained. The sale of the Dronebuster LE model is awaiting rules changes at the FCC that will allow for its use by State and local law enforcement. http://www.radiohilltech.com/ http://www.rada.com/capabilities-3/land-radars-2.htmlhttp://www.rada.com/capabilities-3/land-radars-2.htmlhttp://www.radiohilltech.com/COUNTER UAS DIRECTORY  SEPTEMBER 2017  Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Drone Dome Drone Dome is an interception system that uses a laser beam to locate and destroy hostile drones. http://www.rafael.co.il/4312-en/Marketing.aspx http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-rafael-unveils-laser-based-drone-interception-system-1001193645 Raytheon Phalanx A self-contained package, the Phalanx weapon system automatically carries out functions usually performed by multiple systems: search, detection, threat evaluation, tracking, engagement and kill assessment.
