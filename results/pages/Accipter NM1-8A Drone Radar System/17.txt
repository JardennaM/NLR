Accipiter’s Radar Intelligence Network™ Platform TechnologyAccipiter offers several carefully engineered systems to address your particular aviation safety and security problems, and they are all built on our patented and game-changing Radar Intelligence Network™ (RIN) platform technology. The RIN architecture ensures your system can easily adapt and grow with your changing threats and needs. Our novel approach to wide-area, real-time detection, tracking, post processing, and display coupled with on-the-fly and interactive analytics applied to historical target data sets us apart from any other radar systems provider, by giving you unprecedented situational understanding and decision support. Our RIN allows any number of sensors to seamlessly connect over any TCP/IP network to our patented M3® Target Information System which forms the heart of all our delivered systems. And because the RIN was engineered to be radar agnostic, the right radar sensor(s) can be selected for your problem. M3® Target Information System (TIS)Accipiter’s multi-sensor, multi-mission, multi-user M3® Target Information System (TIS) provides the ultimate in multi-sensor target data processing, query and retrieval, enabling rapid and efficient understanding that leads to strategic and tactical decision making. The TIS not only organizes, stores indefinitely, fuses, manages and distributes the rich sensor target data in earth coordinates; but it also drives an ecosystem of user apps we call Surveillance-to-Intelligence™ (S2I) tools to deliver tactical and strategic information to users. Furthermore, the TIS integrates with a Device Activation Processor (DAP) that can be radar-activated to fire deterrent devices and trigger camera geo-coordinate queuing in response to identified target scenarios. And real-time replication technology (RTRT) mirrors the TIS to other locations for partner information sharing, data redundancy and evidence protection. The TIS also integrates with your third-party C2, dashboard and enterprise geographical information systems; and enables development of specific analysis and display tools by customers themselves. Any number of users can simultaneously operate their favorite S2I tools. Surveillance-to-Intelligence ™ (S2I) ToolsAccipiter provides a suite of easy to use S2I tools, giving users with different roles or missions the situational understanding they need to be more effective at performing their duties. Tactical tools such as the Accipiter® Radar Common Operating Picture (COP) and ThreatViewer™ give watch standers and dispatchers a real-time map-view of target tracks from all sensors with built-in, 24-hour rapid replay along with alerts in response to detected threats of interest. Our tablet-based Mobile Response COP gives responders in vehicles a user-centric display, allowing them to more easily put their own eyes on live targets of interest so they can take action. Our strategic S2I tools interactively or on-the-fly rapidly mine the TIS’s historical target data to give analysts understanding of target activity patterns; and managers specialized reporting with metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) that allow them to better manage and allocate resources to mitigate risk. The Accipiter® Track Histories Viewer delivers spatial patterns of tracks around your aerodrome every hour, while the Accipiter® Target Analyzer Software (TAS) allows the analyst to generate a variety of temporal and spatial target activity distributions including heat maps, all filtered by time, date, size, speed, heading and altitude.
