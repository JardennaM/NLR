It is used to detect the incursion of unwant-ed drones, based on the directional real-time mea-surement of the electromagnetic emissions of thedrone and its remote control. It warns the operatorwhen drones are in the area and send alerts. Drones can be more than just an annoyanceThe  rapid  proliferation  of  micro/mini  UAVs  is  a growing  potential  threat  to  national  and  com-mercial  security. Easy  to  produce,  cheap  to  buy, simple  to  fly,  and  hard to detect, commercially and  non  commercial-ly  available  drones  are one  of  the  most  quick-ly  evolving  technolog-ical  threats  to  military and  civilian interests. A  commercial  drone reportedly  alarmed  the Secret Service in March 2015  when  the  aircraft flew  too  close  to  Pres-ident  Barack  Obama during a round of golf in Florida. Detection RangeThe system has no limitation in detection range, usually the detection range is the same as the us-able distance from the operator to the drone (or better),  so  it  always  depends  on  the  transmitter power  of  the  drone/operator. Depending  on  the drone type, it could be several km / miles without problems. Early detectionThe  AARTOS  Drone  Detector  already  gives  an alarm  as  soon  as  a  remote  control  is  on  air,  so even before the drone is in the air. Countermea-sures can therefore be initiated at an early stage. Aaronia Drone Detector can be used anywhereThe drone detection system can be used virtually anywhere. Typical  use  scenarios  are  the  protec-tion  of  residential  areas,  governmental  buildings and  commercial  /  industrial  areas  like  nuclear plants. Available  as  single-side  or  multiple-side solution, the system is adjustable to the charac-teristics of the terrain to be monitored. HardwareThe  drone  detector  is  based  on  the  Aaronia  Iso-LOG  3D  antenna,  a  real-time  Spectrum  Analyzer (XFR  V5  PRO,  RR  or RF  Command  Center) and a special software plugin  for  the  RTSA Suite software. All parts combined allow a 24/7 monitoring and re-cording with a gapless data-streaming. The system  saves  consid-erable  measurement time  and  is  compact and  flexible. It  can  be set up at any place you need to control. Typical Detection Range of the AARTOS DDS3Advantages of a radio communication solutionThe RF detection of the drone signals has minor advantages compared to other methods such as radar, optical and acoustic detection:• Safe detection without false alarmsThe system can not be irritated by other flying objects such as birds, balloons or dragons. • Early detectionThe  AARTOS  DDS  already  gives  an  alarm  as soon as a remote control is turned on, so even before the drone is in the air. Countermeasures can therefore be initiated at an early stage. • Tracking the drone ownerSince  the  Aaronia  AARTOS  DDS  detects  both the  drone  via  its  downlink  signals  as  well  as the remote control, the direction of both can be tracked immediately. When 3 or more systems are used, the exact position can be determined via triangulation. Made in GermanyThe Aaronia AARTOS DDS is developed, individ-ually manufactured and calibrated in Germany. This guarantees highest standards. Counter-MeasuresThe  system  can  be  extended  by  a  jammer  that can effectively prevent RF contact to a drone to force it into the fail-safe mode, e.g. to land or to hover. The interference is extremely selective, that other RF channels are not impaired. Besides the selectivity the jammer is highly direc-tional and only jams in the direction of the incom-ing UAV. This picture shows the map view of the AARTOS DDS, with triangualted position of the drone (red) inside a warning area (yellow). The DDS shows even the type of detected drone and can handle an unlimited number of drones simultaneously. 4Single Site / Portable SolutionThe single site solution is ready to use within a few minutes only. Based on a stationary or mobile SpectrumAnalyzer (RF Command Center or XFR V5 PRO, see page 6) and the 3D direction finding antenna IsoLOG 3D,this solution is the first choice for surveillance of smaller areas, e.g. a house or a prison. Multi-Site SolutionThe multi solution consists of several antennas (IsoLOG 3D) and analyzers (Spectran V5 Rugged Rack), cou-pled together to one centralized monitoring PC which manages all systems simultaneously. The advantage of the multi solution is the possibility to triangulate the signals. This leads to a very high tracking accuracy. Furthermore, the multi solution can combine an unlimited number of receivers, thus it’s suitable to protect very large areas e.g. industry plants, stadiums, government buildings etc. 5System VersionsX3X5X7X9500m - 1km1km - 2km2km - 5km3km - 7kmOmnidirectionalOmnidirectional-184 - 6°B2161 - 3°A2161 - 3°A2HoppingHoppingHoppingReal-Time1No-1Yes1km1 (2 - Optional)4-8 (unlimited additional receivers)Yes2kmYes2kmRangeSectorsTracking Accuracy (Line of Sight)ITU Class for Tracking AccuracyAmpsSimultaneous Band CoverageReceiversScalableRecommended Grid DistanceIncluded EquipmentV5 XFR Pro,IsoLOG 3D MobileCommand Center / XFR Pro /RR,IsoLOG 3DCommand Center / XFR Pro /RR,IsoLOG 3DUWB,IsoLOG 3DUsing a GRID (X5 - X7 - X9)When using the AARTOS DDS as a scalable grid solution  for  drone  and  RF  detection,  we  recom-mend placing the antenna + receiver combos at certain  distances  from  one  another  in  order  to assure  the  best  coverage  and  detection  without gaps. For the X5 we recommend a maximum dis-tance of 1km, for the X7 and X9 a maximum dis-tance of 2km. The  GRID  system  can  be  conveniently  remotely controlled from a centralized location. 2km1kmX51km2kmX7 & X9= Antenna + Receiver= Surveillance Room6System VersionsX3 (Mobile)X5 (Base)Designed to be used as an easily portable drone and jammer detection device.
