The  SPECTRAN  V5 is  the  culmination  of  Aaronia’s  efforts  in  building the  spectrum analyzer with best price-performance ratio  on  the  market. It  scans  20GHz  in  less  than 20  milliseconds,  which  is  an  astonishing  speed  of 1000GHz per second. With this spectrum analyzer you can master all the challenges. Whether it is for spectrum monitoring, RF  and  microwave  measurements  or  Interference hunting,  EMC  testing,  Wi-Fi  and  wireless  network measurements, RF surveillance and counter-surveil-lance measurements, the SPECTRAN V5 is always the ideal spectrum analyzer for making fast and reli-able measurements. A weight of just 850g e.g. predestines the V5 Hand-held for measurements in the field yet it can also be used in the lab. The included PC analysis software RTSA  Suite  transforms  each  V5  into  fully-featured benchtop spectrum analyzers. aaronia.com/v5-seriesFAST, FASTER, V5With more than 100 million samples per second the V5 sets itself worlds apart from any comparable re-al-time spectrum analyzer. The V5 offers a real-time bandwidth up to 350MHz, combined  with affordable prices and intuitive hard-ware and software layout. The real-time streaming function is another special feature  of  the  SPECTRAN  V5. Contrary  to  existing real-time  spectrum  analyzers,  which  do  not  allow uninterrupted data logging, the V5 can stream data continuously and save them gap-free with unlimited length. Recordings  of  hours,  days  or  even  months can be stored and post-processed. A variety of more advanced software-evaluation and analysis-options  are  currently  under  development and these will be available for retrofit when request-ed (e.g. GSM decoder). Available in 7 different versions (see next page) the V5 offers a solution for almost every RF and micro-wave application. SPECTRAN V5 HANDHELD1Hz to 20GHz, Only 850 grams, Incl.

Built-in amplifiers, extremely high directionality with 1° accuracy and phenomenal gain are the main advantages of these unique antennas. ISOLOG 3D MOBILEISOTROPIC ANTENNA9kHz - 6GHzHARDWAREEach  IsoLOG  3D  Mobile  includes  an  internal,  re-chargeable  battery,  offering  a  run-time  of  6  hours, and a switchable low noise bypass preamplifier. The  integrated  amp  allows  measurements  of  very low-powered  signals. Thus,  used  in  bypass  mode, the antenna is still usable for high field-strengths. The  control  of  the  antenna  is  done  via  USB  or  via manual  antenna  selection mode,  requiring  no  USB connection. Aaronia  also  integrated  an  ultra  fast  adjustable „chopper“  function. Using  special,  glitch  free  RF switches  this  feature  offers  an  automatic  endless antenna rotation/selection with a switching duration of up to 50kHz. This feature transforms the IsoLOG 3D Mobile into a fully functional 3D antenna without the need of any USB software control.

The BPSG generators offer precision generated RF signals for the testing of EMC-shielding and EMI/RFI measurements. Available in 4 different versions the generators  cover  frequency  ranges  from  23,5MHz up to 6GHz. The  UBBV  pre-amplifiers  are  portable  amps  which work with any brand of spectrum analyzer, but are also  designed  to  mount  directly  to  our  Aaronia SPECTRAN Handheld models for complete integrat-ed  operation. Eight  different  models  cover  DC  to 20GHz and offer up to 40dB gain, available with and without bypass options. With the very compact dimensions of just 80x50x30 mm  and weighing only 150 grams, the UBBV and BPSG series are predestined for mobile use and fit in every pocket. The compact form factor makes them the world’s smallest, battery-powered RF generators and pre-amplifiers up to 20GHz. VERSIONSTYPE              RANGEGAIN /POWER OUT.

In standalone mode the generator can produce sim-ple or very complex batch programs that automat-ically  start  after  power  up. This  allows  for  a  fixed level frequency or the start of a pre-defined sweep, complex frequency lists, modulation, etc. All the generators and pre-amps are designed and manufactured in Germany. aaronia.com/amps AARONIASHIELDING MATERIALSDC to 50GHz, 110dB AttenuationOVER 110dB ATTENUATIONWith their EMC high-tech fleeces, meshes and fab-rics, Aaronia offers some of the world‘s most effi-cient shielding performance of over 110dB, unique in this price category and with such material char-acteristics. These  materials  are  easy  to  handle  - even for novices - offering simultaneous  protection  against    high-frequency    (RF)    and    low-frequency (LF)  E-field  radiation. The  secrets  behind  this  ex-treme  efficiency  are  patented  manufacturing  pro-cesses coupled with special, high-quality materials. Aaronia  shielding materials are easy to handle and to install, can be folded without taking damage, are sturdy,  frost-  and weatherproof (depending on the material) and can even be installed in concrete. As such,  they  are  also  suitable  for  outdoor  use  while still being very affordable. Aaronia  materials  can  be  used  both  for  shielding against  electric  fields  from  local  radiation  sourc-es like 50Hz power cables, as well as for shielding rooms or entire houses or other buildings against RF radiation. Installation is performed by attaching the material in adjacent lanes with overlapping seams of approx. 15cm to guarantee a closed surface.

They are often far too difficult to handle, particularly for the novice, but also for professional users. Apart from this, they are typically far too expensive. Also, customers often need two separate shielding solu-tions  simultaneously, as most RF shielding materi-als offer hardly any protection against low-frequen-cy fields, and vice-versa. aaronia.com/shield27090 AARONIADRONE DETECTION SYSTEMSmart-Pattern-Trigger  |  24/7 Unlimited RecordingTHE UAV DETECTION SYSTEMAfter 4 years of development Aaronia introduces its new  Drone  Detection  System. The  Aaronia  Drone Detector is used to detect the incursion of unwanted drones, based on the directional real-time  measure-ment of the electromagnetic emissions of  drones. It warns the operator when drones approach the area and automatically sends alerts. The system has no limitation in detection range, usu-ally the detection range is the same as the  usable distance from the operator to the drone (or better) so it always depends on the transmitter  power of the drone/operator. Depending on the  drone type it could be several km / miles without problems, e.g. a DJI Phantom 3 can be detected from 3km distance approx. The drone detection system can be used anywhere. Typical  scenarios  are  the  protection  of  residential areas,  governmental  buildings,  prisons  and  com-mercial / industrial areas like nuclear plants. Avail-able as  single-side or multiple-side solution the sys-tem is adjustable to the characteristics of the terrain to be monitored. HIGHLIGHTSHIGHLIGHTSAll-In-One SolutionSmart-Pattern-Recognition24/7 Unlimited RecordingSmart-Alarm-TriggerUltra-High RangeEarly-Warning CapableTailored Solutions on RequestHARDWAREThe drone detector is based on the Aaronia IsoLOG3D  antenna,  the  SPECTRAN  real-time  spectrum analyzers V5 XFR Pro or RF Command Center and a special software plug-in for the RTSA Suite soft-ware. As a fully integrated system, the Aaronia DDS allows for 24/7 monitoring and recording with  gap-less  data-streaming  (up  to  4TB/day). The  system saves considerable measurement time and is com-pact and flexible. It works at night, fog and bad weather with a very high  tracking  accuracy. Combined  with  at  least  3 systems the DDS allows to triangulate the positions of the drone and / or the operator.
