After four years of development, Aaronia introduced its drone detection system - the AARTOS DDS. Designed to detect intruding drones, the system is based on real-time directional measurements of the drone´s electromagnetic emissions (including its remote control). It warns its users of incoming drones and sends alerts. Drones – More than just a nuisance The increasingly easy access to mini and micro UAVs makes them a growing potential threat to national and commercial security. Easy to produce, cheap to buy, simple to fly, and hard to detect, commercially and non-commercially available drones are among the most quickly evolving technological threats to military and civilian interests. In the US, a commercial drone reportedly alarmed the Secret Service in March 2015 when the UAV flew too close to the President’s golf resort. Ready for action when you need it Aaronia’s  drone  detection  system  can  be  used virtually anywhere. Typical use cases include the protection of borders, sports events or concerts, residential areas, governmental facilities as well as commercial or industrial sites such as nuclear plants. Available as a single-site or multiple-site solution, the system can be adjusted to the charac- teristics of the respective terrain to be monitored. Detection range The system features a virtually unlimited detection range. Usually, the detection range is equal to (or better than) the maximum distance between the operator and the drone, thus depending on the transmitter power of the drone and / or its operator. Taking into account various factors such as drone type and topography, this range can be up to 50 km or more. Countermeasures The system can be extended to include an auto- mated integrated jammer that effectively prevents a drone from receiving RF signals, thus forcing it into a fail-safe mode, e.g. to hover and land safely or to return to its point of origin.The interference is extremely selective, so that other RF channels are not impaired. Besides being highly selective, the jammer is extremely directional and only jams in the direction of the incoming UAV. Advantages of the system The advantages of the Aaronia Real-Time Drone Detection System are: Extremely high coverage (up to 50km - Airport solution)3D multi-functional flight pass viewHigh tracking accuracy of up to 1°Identifies the drone make and model (e.g. DJI Phantom 4)Also works at night, fog and bad weatherWorks also against drones "disguised" between buildings, industrial plants, trees..High tracking accuracyPossibility to track the operator who controls the drone Ready for use within a few minutes (mobile system)DF measurement accuracy up to ITU class AEnables 24/7 seamless recording and monitoring360 degree coverageIntelligent analyzing i.e. automatic alarmSoftware identifies the drone with the help of so-called 3d trigger  Made in Germany:The Drone Detection System is developed, individually assembled and calibrated in Germany. This guarantees highest production and quality standards. How to get further InformationInterested in the Detection System?
