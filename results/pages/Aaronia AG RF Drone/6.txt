Based on a stationary or mobile SpectrumAnalyzer (see page 6) and the 3D direction finding antenna IsoLOG 3D, this solution is the first choice for surveil-lance of small areas, e.g. a house. Multiple Sides Solution The multi solution consists of several antennas and analyzers, coupled together to one centralized monitoring PCwhich manages all systems simultaneously. The advantage of the multi solution is the possibility to triangulate thereadings. This leads to a very high tracking accuracy. Further the multi solution can combine an unlimited number of receivers, thus it´s suitable to protect very largeareas e.g. industry plants, stadiums, government buildings etc. Hardware Part 1 (Antenna)IsoLOG 3D 80-UWBIsoLOG 3D 160-UWB (higher accuracy)OR8 sectors with 24 antennas Frequency range: 9kHz to 6 / 20 GHz16 sectors with 48 antennas Frequency range: 9kHz to 6 / 20 GHzFrequency rangeFrequency rangeStandard9kHz to 6GHzStandard9kHz to 6GHzVLF Extender to 9kHz (option)IncludedVLF Extender to 9kHz (option)IncludedSHF Extender to 20GHz (option)YesSHF Extender to 20GHz (option)YesAdditional OptionsAdditional OptionsInternal GPS receiverYesInternal GPS receiverYesInternal low noise pre-amplifierYes (up to 20dB)Internal low noise pre-amplifierYes (up to 20dB)Customized color (RAL table)8x horizontal LPDA´s in additionYesYesCustomized color (RAL table)8x horizontal LPDA´s in additionYesYesMechanical & environmentalMechanical & environmentalPowervia included PoE adapterPowervia included PoE adapterOperating temperature-30 to +60°C (-22 to 140°F)Operating temperature-30 to +60°C (-22 to 140°F)Storage temperature-40 to +70°C (-40 to 158°F)Storage temperature-40 to +70°C (-40 to 158°F)DimensionsWeightRF OutputWarranty950 x 950 x 300mmDimensions950 x 950 x 300mm4kg (8kg with mounting plate)Weight5kg (9kg with mounting plate)N or SMA (50Ohm)10 yearsRF OutputWarrantyN or SMA (50Ohm)10 yearsHardware Part 2 (Spectrum Analyzer)XFR V5 PRO (portable)RF Command Center (stationary)Real-Time Outdoor Spectrum Analyzer (IP65 rated)with fully featured PC and Drone Detection SoftwareReal-Time  RF Command  Center  with  fully  featu-red PC and Drone Detection SoftwareORFrequency rangeFrequency rangeStandard9kHz to 20GHzStandard9kHz to 20GHzTechnical specsTechnical specsReal-time bandwidth80MHz (optionally 175MHz)Real-time bandwidth80MHz (optionally 175MHz)Minimum Event Duration for 100% POI20µs (optionally 1µs)Minimum Event Duration for 100% POI20µs (optionally 1µs)GPSTrigger with automated alarmInbuiltYesGPSOptionalTrigger with automated alarmYesMechanical & environmentalMechanical & environmentalOperation modevia battery or power supplyOperation modevia power supply onlyOperating temperature-20 to +60°C Operating temperature0 to +45°C Storage temperature-40 to +70°C Storage temperature-10 to +60°C DimensionsWeightCountry of OriginWarranty41x32x12cm8,5kgGermany2 yearsDimensionsWeightCountry of OriginWarranty54x28x37cm (monitors closed)25kg (34kg with rollcase)Germany2 yearsSoftwareRF & Drone Detector Plugin for Aaronia RTSA Suite The drone detection software offers an intuitive layout combined with powerful tracking, trigger and displayoptions helping to identify, capture and track any RF emissions from drones/UAV´s or other RF sources upto 20GHz.
