Detection RangeThe system has no limitation in detection range, usu-ally  the  detection  range  is  the  same  as  the  usabledistance from the operator to the drone (or better), soit  always  depends  on  the  transmitter  power  of  thedrone/operator. Depending on the drone type, it could beseveral km / miles without problems. Early detectionThe Aaronia Drone Detector already gives an alarmas soon as a remote control is on air, so even beforethe drone is in the air. Countermeasures can therefo-re be initiated at an early stage. Typical Detection Range of the Aaronia DDS3311 Lewis Ave, Signal Hill CA 90755, 408-916-5750, www.reliantemc.com Distributed by: Reliant EMC LLC, Advantages of a radio communication solutionThe rf detection of the drone signals has minor advan-tages compared to other methods such as radar, opti-cal and acoustic detection:w Safe detection without false alarmsThe  system  can  not  be  irritated  by  other  flyingobjects such as birds, balloons or dragons. wEarly detectionThe  Aaronia  DDS  already  gives  an  alarm  assoon as a remote control is turned on, so evenbefore the drone is in the air. Countermeasurescan therefore be initiated at an early stage. wTracking the drone ownerSince  the Aaronia  Drone  Detector  detects  boththe drone via its downlink signals as well as theremote control, the direction of both can be trak-ked  immediately. When  3  or  more  systems  areused, the exact position can be determined viatriangulation. Counter-MeasuresThe  system  can  be  extended  by  a  jammer  that  caneffectively prevent rf contact to a drone to force it intothe fail-safe mode, e.g. to land or to hover. The inter-ference  is  extremely  selective,  that  other  rf  channelsare not impaired. Made in GermanyBesides the selectivity the jammer is highly directionalmanufactured  and  calibrated  in  Germany. This  gua-and only jams in the direction of the incoming UAV. rantees highest standards. The Aaronia Drone Detector is developed, individuallyThis picture shows the map view of the Aaronia DDS, with direction and position of the drone (red) and the operator (blue). The DDS shows even the type of detected drone and can handle an unlimited number of drones simultaneously. Single Side Solution The single side solution is ready to use within a few minutes only. Based on a stationary or mobile SpectrumAnalyzer (RF Command Center or XFR V5 PRO, see page 6) and the 3D direction finding antenna IsoLOG 3D,this solution is the first choice for surveillance of small areas, e.g. a house. Multiple Sides Solution The multi solution consists of several antennas (IsoLOG 3D) and analyzers (Spectran V5 ODB - Outdoor analy-zer), coupled together to one centralized monitoring PC which manages all systems simultaneously. The advanta-ge of the multi solution is the possibility to triangulate the signals. This leads to a very high tracking accuracy. Furthermore, the multi solution can combine an unlimited number of receivers, thus it´s suitable to protect verylarge areas e.g. industry plants, stadiums, government buildings etc. 3311 Lewis Ave, Signal Hill CA 90755, 408-916-5750, www.reliantemc.com Distributed by: Reliant EMC LLC, Hardware Part 1 (Antenna)IsoLOG 3D 80IsoLOG 3D 160 (higher accuracy)OR8 sectors with 16 antennas Frequency range: 680MHz (9kHz) to 6 / 20 GHz16 sectors with 32 antennas Frequency range: 680MHz (9kHz) to 6 / 20 GHzFrequency rangeFrequency rangeStandard680MHz to 6GHzStandard680MHz to 6GHzVLF Extender to 9kHz (option)YesVLF Extender to 9kHz (option)YesSHF Extender to 20GHz (option)YesSHF Extender to 20GHz (option)YesAdditional OptionsAdditional OptionsInternal GPS receiverYesInternal GPS receiverYesInternal low noise pre-amplifierYes (included)Internal low noise pre-amplifierYes ( included)Customized color (RAL table)8x horizontal LPDA´s in additionYesYesCustomized color (RAL table)8x horizontal LPDA´s in additionYesYesMechanical & environmentalMechanical & environmentalPowervia included PoE adapterPowervia included PoE adapterOperating temperature-30 to +60°C (-22 to 140°F)Operating temperature-30 to +60°C (-22 to 140°F)Storage temperature-40 to +70°C (-40 to 158°F)Storage temperature-40 to +70°C (-40 to 158°F)DimensionsWeightRF OutputWarranty950 x 950 x 300mmapprox. 20kgN (50Ohm)2 yearsDimensionsWeightRF OutputWarranty950 x 950 x 300mmapprox. 20kgN (50Ohm)2 years3311 Lewis Ave, Signal Hill CA 90755, 408-916-5750, www.reliantemc.com Distributed by: Reliant EMC LLC, Hardware Part 2 (Spectrum Analyzer)XFR V5 PRO (portable)RF Command Center (stationary)Real-Time Outdoor Spectrum Analyzer (IP65 rated)with fully featured PC and Drone Detection SoftwareReal-Time  RF Command  Center  with  fully  featu-red PC and Drone Detection SoftwareORFrequency rangeFrequency rangeStandard9kHz to 20GHzStandard9kHz to 20GHzTechnical specsTechnical specsReal-time bandwidth160 / 175MHzReal-time bandwidth160 / 175MHzMinimum Event Duration for 100% POI20µs (optionally 1µs)Minimum Event Duration for 100% POI20µs (optionally 1µs)GPSTrigger with automated alarmInbuiltYesGPSOptionalTrigger with automated alarmYesMechanical & environmentalMechanical & environmentalOperation modevia battery or power supplyOperation modevia power supply onlyOperating temperature-20 to +60°C Operating temperature0 to +45°C Storage temperature-40 to +70°C Storage temperature-10 to +60°C DimensionsWeightCountry of OriginWarranty41x32x12cm8,5kgGermany2 yearsDimensionsWeightCountry of OriginWarranty54x28x37cm (monitors closed)25kg (34kg with rollcase)Germany2 years3311 Lewis Ave, Signal Hill CA 90755, 408-916-5750, www.reliantemc.com Distributed by: Reliant EMC LLC, ReferencesCross-Section of Aaronia ClientsGovernment, Military, Aeronautic, AstronauticIndustrywwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwNATO,  BelgiumDepartment of Defense, USADepartment of Defense, AustraliaAirbus, GermanyBoeing, USABundeswehr, GermanyNASA, USALockheed Martin, USALufthansa, GermanyDLR,GermanyEurocontrol, Belgium EADS, GermanyDEA, USAFBI, USABKA, GermanyFederal Police, GermanyMinistry of Defense, NetherlandsResearch/Development, Science and UniversitieswwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwMIT - Physics Department, USACalifornia State University, USAIndonesien Institute of Sience, Indonesia Los Alamos National Labratory, USA University of Bahrain, BahrainUniversity of Florida, USAUniversity of Victoria, CanadaUniversity of Newcastle, United KingdomUniversity of Durham, United KingdomUniversity Strasbourg, FranceUniversity of Sydney, AustraliaUniversity of Athen, GreeceUniversity of Munich, GermanyTechnical University of Hamburg, Germany Max-Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy, GermanyMax-Planck-Institute for Nuclear Physics, Germany Research Centre Karlsruhe, GermanywwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwAPPLE, USAIBM, SwitzerlandIntel, GermanyShell Oil Company, USAATI, USAMicrosoft, USAMotorola, BrazilAudi, GermanyBMW, GermanyDaimler, GermanyVolkswagen, GermanyBASF, GermanySiemens AG, GermanyRohde & Schwarz, GermanyInfineon, AustriaPhilips, GermanyThyssenKrupp, GermanyEnBW, GermanyCNN, USADuracell, USAGerman Telekom, GermanyBank of Canada, CanadaNBC News, USASony, GermanyAnritsu, Germany Hewlett Packard, GermanyRobert Bosch, GermanyMercedes Benz, AustriaOsram, GermanyDEKRA, GermanyAMD, GermanyKeysight, ChinaInfineon Technologies, GermanyPhilips Semiconductors, Germany Hyundai Europe, GermanyVIAVI, KoreaWilkinson Sword, GermanyIBM Deutschland, GermanyNokia-Siemens Networks, GermanyM a d e   i n   G e r m a n y3311 Lewis Ave, Signal Hill CA 90755, 408-916-5750, www.reliantemc.com Distributed by: Reliant EMC LLC, Spectran®HyperLOG®BicoLOG®OmniLOG®Aaronia-Shield® Aaronia X-Dream® MagnoShield®IsoLOG®are registered trademarks of Aaronia AG
