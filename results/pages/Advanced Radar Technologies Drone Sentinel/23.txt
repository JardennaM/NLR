They are small in size, making them hard to detect. They can be carried easily on a backpack, launched and recovered almost in any terrains. They are capable of providing real-time situational awareness information through live videos and high-definition pictures. Thus they can pose real and significant threats to military operations, such as those that are foreseen to be conducted by the CAF expeditionary force in the Arctic. A survey is conducted on various methods for detecting the presence of small drones. A summary is given on the effectiveness of these methods. It is concluded that passive radar detection and radio-frequency detection hold good promise as useful techniques for countermeasures against drone surveillance.

De taille réduite, ils sont difficiles à détecter et facilement transportables dans un sac à dos. Ils peuvent ainsi être lancés et récupérés sur quasiment tous les types de terrains. Les UAV permettent d’obtenir de l’information en temps réel sur la connaissance de la situation par l’entremise d’images vidéo en direct et en haute définition. Ils constituent donc une menace réelle et importante pour les opérations militaires, comme celles que devrait mener le corps expéditionnaire des FAC dans l’Arctique.

DRDC-RDDC-2016-D019         vi 1 Introduction Mini-UAVs and micro-UAVs are seen as a technology that is increasingly posing serious threats to military operations and public security. These unmanned flying systems are commonly referred to simply as drones. They are physically small in size, and light in weight. A typical drone such as the popular and ubiquitous quadcopter is less than 1 m in overall length or width, and weighs less than 15 kg in maximum take-off weight. Such drone system can be carried easily on the backpacks of ground troopers. The cost of a quadcopter system including sensors such as  first-person-view video cameras (remote piloting) and HD cameras is relatively cheap, priced at less than $1000 per drone [1] and it is expected to fall as the market grows; thus it is an affordable and expendable item. This allows the users to push its operating envelop to the extreme limit, even to the point of sacrificing the drone when the acquisition of critical intelligence information is urgently sought. Drones are expected to be used increasingly for scouting-spying and targeting purposes; they are useful for collecting and relaying real-time imagery on-the-fly, providing invaluable instantaneous tactical information in the battlespace. As a matter of fact, drones are reported being used by the Russians frequently in the Syrian conflict [2]. Battery-operated drones with range greater than 50 km are already available in the commercial hobby market [3]. The range performance is expected to improve as more efficient motors and higher capacity batteries are becoming available. It is also foreseen that SATCOM-capable drones will be available by 2020 as a technology trend [4]; this allows beyond line-of-sight communication between a low-flying drone and the ground controller stationed at a distance. For example, a drone flying at an altitude of 500 m (height of CN Tower) has a line-of-sight range of about 80 km; satellite data link allows a much greater stand-off distance for the controller. Improvements in drone, sensor and data communication technologies will undoubtedly pose serious threats to the CAF’s operations, especially those in the Arctic. It is foreseen that the CAF could deploy an expeditionary force patrolling the Arctic in the future to maintain sovereignty; this could potentially bring them in contact with foreign state-armed or privately-armed forces. Mobile forward operating bases for the CAF and sensitive operating areas will be vulnerable to foreign drone ISR activities. It is thus imperative for the CAF to be aware of any adversarial spying activities monitoring its operations [5]. Hence, a capability in countermeasures against drone surveillance will be necessary in order to provide security protection for the CAF to conduct their operations effectively in the Arctic. DRDC-RDDC-2016-D019 1     2  Detection methods There are a number of different approaches to drone detection. The following is a brief description of each of the methods summarizing the technology trends discussed on the internet. The focus is on the small drones that can provide real-time tactical information data. Also, they are very transportable, can be launched and recovered easily in any terrain, and are difficult to detect. 2.1  Audio detection Noise from spinning propellers and electric motors can be detected by acoustic sensors such as microphones; but they have a limited range of about 100–150 m. A database of acoustic signatures from various drone models is compiled to discriminate ambient noises, preventing false alarm to set off. However, drone noise signature can be altered or muffled easily to defeat the database. Moreover, audio detection cannot be used to track target easily or accurately; it can only detect the presence of a drone in the vicinity and provides a warning. Nonetheless, audio sensors for detecting drones such as quadcopters are already commercially available for home privacy application [6] and commercial applications [7]. They are reported to have deployed around nuclear power plants and affluent neighbourhoods. Video detection 2.2 Video cameras provide also a relatively short range detection, about 100 m [8]. It does not work well in misty, foggy conditions and at night. Because drones fly at low speed, around 16 m/s  (58 km/hr), cameras may have difficulty distinguishing between drones and birds, especially when the birds are gliding. This may trigger an unacceptably high rate of false alarm. However, there may be AI (Artificial Intelligence) computer software available soon that may help to differentiate drones from birds on video/camera images through motion analysis. Thermal detection 2.3 Thermal detection also has a range of about 100 meters and is subjected to weather conditions. Thermal shielding of the electric motors can further degrade the effectiveness of thermal detection. Most drones are built of plastic and carbon fibre materials. Thermal detection is found to be problematic in detecting these materials [8]. Infra-red cameras are more likely to pick up small birds due to their large thermal signatures, thus potentially causing a high rate of  false alarm. 2 DRDC-RDDC-2016-D019           2.4  Radar detection Conventional radar systems for drone detection are available. These systems can pick up drones which have radar cross-section (RCS) the size of small birds (0.01 m2) at a range up to 2 km using very low transmitted power [9]. System that tracks small drones up to 20 km is claimed  to exist [10]. However, there have been reports that radars have difficulties picking up small drone targets [8] [11] even though the drone RCS is within the detectable value. The problem is that subtle radar returns are hard to differentiate between those of a small drone and those from small birds and other sources of clutter. For drones that fly at low altitude and slow speed, unwanted clutters are problematic [12]. Furthermore, because birds have similar RCS as small drones, false alarm rate can be high. But with the advent of AI (artificial intelligence) technology, this problem may soon be solved in which an AI algorithm can differentiate a bird from a drone by analyzing the motion characteristic in the  signals [12]. Another potential problem with radar detection is the requirement of continuous transmission of RF radiation. In an urban environment setting, placing a radar transmitter close to where people work and live may raise radiation health concerns. It may not be acceptable to the people living near the vicinity where a radar transmitter is emitting non-stop. Furthermore, the cost of operating a transmitter continuously 24/7 is another issue. One potential use of radar detection in an urban setting is passive radar exploiting existing  TV-signal towers as transmitters of opportunity. Firstly, TV-signals transmitted by major TV channels are powerful enough for detecting drones, even very small ones. Since TV transmission towers have been a fixture in the urban landscape for a long time, people are used to and accepting their presence. Secondly, TV-signal is free of charge; there is essentially no cost for tapping into the TV-signal transmission. Thirdly, TV-signals are transmitted continuously  24/7, making it an ideal source for radar surveillance application. Using Ottawa as an example for passive radar detection of small drones in an urban setting, the TV-signal transmitter located at Camp Fortune can be exploited as a transmitter of opportunity to monitor critical high-value infrastructure assets against small drone spying activities. All of these target locations are within a 17 km radius from the TV transmission tower. For a small drone even the size of an insect (RCS = 0.001 m2), passive radar using TV signal is capable of detecting such small targets. A sample calculation estimating the detection requirements is shown in  Table 1. These requirements can be met readily using current COTS technologies. DRDC-RDDC-2016-D019       3     Table 1: Nano drone detection by passive radar over critical  infrastructures using digital TV-signal transmission.

Sightings of drones near the flight paths of jetliners are being reported more frequently and these drones are becoming a real hazard to air traffic. The TV tower at Camp Fortune has adequate power to detect insect-size drones in RCS (0.001 m2) operating within a 5 km radius around the Ottawa International Airport. A sample calculation of the detection performance is shown in Table 2. Table 2: Nano drone detection by passive radar around the  Ottawa International Airport using digital TV-signal transmission. Transmitter location TV transmission power, EIRP [19] Frequency (video carrier), f Wavelength, c/f Bandwidth, β Distance from transmitter to target, R1 Distance from target to receiver(s), R2 Target Radar cross-Section, σ Receiver antenna gain, GR Receiver antenna area, A Received power Noise power (receiver front end), η SNR of received signal by receiver Signal integration gain needed to achieve detection threshold SNRDT = 40 Camp Fortune, Quebec 311 KW 537.25 MHz 0.558 m 6 MHz 30 km 5 km 0.001 m2 100 2.5 m2  2.18x10-16 W 2.85x10-14 W 7.64x10-3  5236 4 DRDC-RDDC-2016-D019           2.5  Radio-Frequency (RF) detection Using signals emitted by the drone is seen as another effective way to detect drones. There are already a number of companies marketing the idea and developing such systems [8] [13] [14] [15]. Detecting target RF emission signal is much easier because of the larger signal strength available to the sensors directly from the target. Some of the problems such as clutters and direct-path interference that are present in passive radar systems are also avoided. A drawback of RF detection is that it must rely on the targets to transmit RF emissions. But this is not an overly detrimental factor that may render the method ineffective. Targets have to communicate with the ground controllers in navigation and in imagery collection. Even though drones can be pre-programmed to fly autonomously using GPS coordinates and pre-programmed to record video imagery and therefore emit no RF signals, the intelligence collected are likely to be regarded as sub-optimal and the information is considered as not as useful and desirable as real-time data. The main advantage of using small drone ISR systems is the ability to provide real-time situational awareness through real-time imagery. In modern battlespace, combatants rely on real-time information to understand the surrounding situations and react quickly to gain an advantage. Even in security monitoring applications, spying drones are mostly used to seek instantaneous situational awareness from the on-board camera imagery. The real-time demand means that most of the small drone missions would have to have constant communication link between the operators and the drones. Hence, RF detection is an effective way to detect the threats of drone surveillance by exploiting target RF emissions. Because of the one-way RF propagation and RF emission is mostly omni-directional, RF emission can be detected using smaller equipment; these sensors are comparable to the portable automotive GPS receivers in size. Thus a RF detection system can be very mobile and transportable. This can be appealing to the CAF operating in the Arctic with an expeditionary force that is on the move frequently. RF detection can provide an effective counter-measures protection against drone reconnaissance by adversaries who must rely on real-time RF (communication) link, as pre-programmed GPS drones would neither be practical nor very effective in spying/scouting purposes against a mobile opponent. In the case of applications for drone warning near airports, most of the threats will come from recreational activities of thrill-seeking amateur drone operators. The primary purpose in most of these cases is to use the on-board cameras to create first-person-view imagery in real-time by flying the drones close to in-flight aircraft for amusement. Thus, virtually all of these drones would be emitting RF signals. RF detection can provide accurate tracking of these drones and geo-locating the ground operators. Table 3 shows calculations for a typical commercial recreational drone transmitting video signal to communicate with the operator. It can be seen that it is quite feasible to pick up the emitted signal from a typical drone. DRDC-RDDC-2016-D019       5     Table 3: Detection of RF signal emitted by a typical  drone target (commercial quadcopter). Drone transmitter power, EIRP [20] Frequency (video carrier), f Wavelength, c/f Bandwidth, β Distance from target to receiver(s), R Receiver antenna gain, GR Received power  Noise power (receiver front end), η SNR of received signal by receiver Signal integration gain needed to achieve detection threshold SNRDT = 40 0.1 W 5.8 GHz 0.055 m 17.5 MHz 5 km 4 2.21x10-14 W 8.5x10-14 W 0.26 154 Another potential application for RF detection is detecting and tracking nano-drones. Nano-drones are palm-size or smaller in physical dimensions (see Figures 1, 2). They can disguise their appearance as small birds, making them less conspicuous in hostile environments and harder to detect visually. These nano-drones can carry tiny cameras for surveillance and for remote piloting. Due to their small physical size, they are not able to carry adequate flight battery power to sustain flight longer than a few minutes; there may only be enough flight power capacity to get to and return from a designated target location. But these nano-drones can perch on tree branches and are capable of gripping onto a surface tightly to stay upright while watching a target area (see Figure 3). RF emissions will be transmitted to provide video image to the operator to find a suitable perching spot. Real time relay of imagery during surveillance will also produce  RF emission. Thus, the presence and activities of nano-drones can still be detected even when they are not in flight. In addition, a perched drone cannot be detected by the radar detection method because a stationary drone would be buried among clutters of the surroundings. Figure 1: A tiny eye in the sky [16]. 6 DRDC-RDDC-2016-D019           Figure 2: Nano hummingbird; named one of the “50 best  inventions of 2011” by TIME Magazine [17]. Figure 3: Drone with legs that can perch on a tree branch [18]. For larger SATCOM capable drones, their RF emissions from datalink transmission of data to satellites can be detected and the drone’s track can be monitored. Although their transmitting antennas will have greater directivity and will be pointing upward towards the satellites, their transmitting power is relatively high, around 7 W peak using the Iridium mobile phone handset as a reference. The sidelobe leakage power from the antenna will have sufficient power to be detected by ground sensors. Most sensors are very sensitive; as an example, as little as 10-16 W of the satellite signal can be detected by commercial GPS receivers that are used by automobiles on the roads. The current state-of-the-art detector sensitivity is 10-19 W. Moreover, the uplink signals from the drone to the satellites operate at a different frequency band than the downlink signals from the satellites; thus, the drone’s transmitted signals are distinct to the RF detectors. DRDC-RDDC-2016-D019       7     As commented in the Introduction, some drone ISR missions may push the operation envelop of the drones to the point of making the drones expendable in order to acquire the sought data. RF detection can provide an early detection of the drones, reducing the chance of success of such Kamikaze tactics. In brief, RF detection can offer a practical and effective tool for counter-measures against surveillance by drones of all types and sizes. 8 DRDC-RDDC-2016-D019           3 Summary A survey is conducted on the trend of drone countermeasures methods. It appears that radar detection and RF detection are two effective approaches that hold promise for practical applications. In particular, passive radar exploiting TV-signal transmission looks especially viable for detecting threats posed by very small drones with RCS the size of an insect in urban settings. It is also possible to provide 24/7 monitoring with minimal operating cost since the radar illumination source (TV-signal) is already present in the ambient background and is essentially free. Using the passive detection method already developed in the North Warning Systems study, target positions (i.e., GPS coordinates) can be determined and multiple targets can be tracked simultaneously in real-time [21]. This greatly facilitates the action of neutralizing the intruding drones by either hard-kill or soft-kill. RF detection offers another reliable and effective means of detecting drones of all sizes, as long as the drones are emitting signals. Most of the anticipated scenarios will have the drones transmitting due to the nature of the drone’s mission; for example, real-time spying/reconnaissance, operators deliberately flying their drones close to jetliners around airports. RF detection allows geolocation and tracking of multiple targets. In the case of drones flying near airports, drone operators on the ground can also be located by RF detection. The advantage of RF detection is that no transmitter is required for target illumination. This means the detection system is much simpler, smaller and lighter, making it easier to be installed, un-installed, and moved around quickly. RF detection fits in the niche for a mobile drone countermeasures system that offers the CAF a capability to provide warning of spying activities on their operations. The SIA/ICI-group has been conducting extensive modelling and simulation work on passive radar detection and RF detection concepts. The development is at a point where it is ready for experimental verification to assess and evaluate their practical potentials. An in-house project involving multi-sectional collaborative effort could be initiated to develop prototype systems as demonstrators. This would permit DRDC Ottawa to build up expertise and capability in the technology to support the CAF’s future requirements.

Thus  they  can  pose  real  and significant threats to military operations, such as those that are foreseen to be conducted by the CAF expeditionary force in the Arctic. A  survey  is  conducted  on  various  methods  for  detecting  the  presence  of  small  drones. A summary  is  given  on  the  effectiveness  of  these  methods. It  is  concluded  that  passive  radar detection  and  radio-frequency  detection  hold  good  promise  as  useful  techniques  for countermeasures against drone surveillance. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  De plus en plus, on a recours à de petits véhicules aériens sans pilote (UAV) dans le cadre d’opérations d’espionnage et de reconnaissance. De taille réduite, ils sont difficiles à détecter et facilement transportables dans un sac à dos. Ils peuvent ainsi être lancés et récupérés sur quasiment tous les types de terrains. Les UAV permettent d’obtenir de l’information en temps réel sur la connaissance de la situation par l’entremise d’images vidéo en direct et en haute définition. Ils constituent donc une menace réelle et importante pour les opérations militaires, comme celles que devrait mener le corps expéditionnaire des FAC dans l’Arctique. On procède à un sondage sur les diverses méthodes de détection des UAV de petite taille. Le résumé sur l’efficacité de ces méthodes révèle que les systèmes passifs de détection et les détecteurs de radiofréquences constituent des contremesures prometteuses relativement à la surveillance au moyen d’UAV. 14.
