Amazon has proposed to employ dronesin the future for airborne delivery of packages (Amazon PrimeAir) [11].Beyond their benign uses, civilian drones have increas-ingly been used in problematic ways that have stirred con-cern from the public and authorities. For example, on March29, 2016, a Lufthansa jet came within 200 feet of collidingwith a drone near Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)[30]. Drones have also interfered with ﬁre-ﬁghting aircraftbeing used in the region of forest ﬁres [22]. A drone crashinterrupted a U.S. Open tennis match [33], prompting one ofthe players to say “It was a little bit scary, I have to say, be-cause with all the things happening now in the world, I imag-ine maybe it’s a bomb." Another drone crashed at the WhiteHouse, raising concerns about security risks to governmentbuildings and facilities [18]. In addition, drones have beenaccused of being used to stalk people and violate their pri-vacy [23].Many anti-drone systems have been proposed to disablethe ﬂight capability of drones and thereby combat the threatsposed by such drones. One approach is to shoot a net at theﬂying drones to physically bring them down and prevent fur-ther ﬂight [29]. Another approach is shoot a laser beam atthe drone to disable it [32]. Another solution has been pro-posed to deceive the drone’s localization system by spooﬁngGPS [17]. A further approach is to use electronic means togain control over these drones, hacking into the drone andhijacking its controller by issuing control messages to theapproaching drone [27]. Of course, the simplest approachhas been to shoot down a drone [7]. A fundamental as-sumption of all of these approaches is that the presence ofthe drone has already been detected and is known to the de-fender. While there have been a few systems proposed to de-tect drone’s presence (see Sec. 5), automated cost-effectivedrone detection systems are lacking both in the literature andin industry.In this work, we propose to investigate the use of inexpen-sive commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) technology, e.g. WiFiand inexpensive software-deﬁned radios (SDR), to automat-ically detect drones. We present two main methods, activeto detect the drone by observing the reﬂected wireless sig-nal, and passive to listen to the communication between the17




drone and its controller. The system includes a receivingantenna and a transmitting antenna. In the active approach,the transmitter continuously broadcasts out wireless signal.The receiving antenna then listens to and captures the re-ﬂected signal which bounces off the drone. This reﬂectedsignal, which may contain a unique signature caused by thedrone, is then analyzed to conclude about the presence ofthe drone and its physical characteristics. In the passive ap-proach, only the receiver is needed to detect the drone bylistening to and analyzing the communication signal createdby the drone and its remote controller.Our work makes the following contributions: we ﬁrst dis-cuss the possible solution and challenges of inexpensive au-tonomous RF-based detection of drones; we further presentearly feasibility experiments demonstrating some of the chal-lenges and opportunities of cost-effective RF detection.The following section discusses our system assumptionsand a variety of challenges that we face. We then discuss ourdrone detection principle. Next, we describe a variety of RFmeasurements that we have taken with drones to explore thechallenges enumerated previously. We conclude the paperwith a discussion.2. CHALLENGES AND SYSTEMASSUMPTIONSWe begin by making certain assumptions about the dronedetection and target systems. First, we assume that our de-tection system should consist of low cost COTS components,such as WiFi access points and inexpensive SDRs, e.g. theEttus B200 costs less than $1K. Second, in terms of the tar-get drones, we assume that they are commercially availablesuch as DJI [15], Parrot [24], and hobbyist drones. Thesedrones are typically equipped with a number of propellers,and wirelessly controlled by a remote controller that oper-ates on typical unlicensed radio frequency bands such as2.4Ghz or 5.1Ghz. Moreover, the drone also emanates aradio frequency signal to communicate back to its remotecontroller for controlling and status signals (e.g. batterylevel, wind level, balance, acknowledgment) or for transfer-ring data (e.g video recorded, location, etc).Given these assumptions, the key challenges in develop-ing an RF-based drone detection system include:•Range: Since the signal drops quickly over distance,the system needs to pickup the signal with high sensi-tivity.•Noise: Since the RF band is unlicensed, it is heavilyused by others such as Wi-Fi devices. Hence, we needto be able to eliminate noise by identifying prominentfeatures caused uniquely by drones.•Speed/time: Given the high speed of drones and lim-ited RF detection range, it is important for the systemto scan and capture the signal quickly before the dronegoes out of range.•Urban environment: Many of the problematic scenar-ios involving drones occur in urban environments withbuildings around in which RF interference and multi-path may be exacerbated. Therefore, the system needsDrone Detection SystemTx RxDrone Detection SystemRx(a) (b)Drone ControllerFigure 1: The overview of drone detection system: (a)active and (b) passive approaches.to be designed to address issues caused by multipatheffects.•Low cost: The detection system needs to be constructedfrom COTS components to maintain a low total cost.We note that while overcoming all of these challenges arecritical to realize the proposed system, we now only discussabout the challenges regarding range, noise, and urban en-vironment in this work and aim to addresses the remaining(speed/detection time) in the future. In addition, we will alsopresent the key challenges of realizing proposed solutions.3. DRONE DETECTION PRINCIPLEIn this section, we present different approaches for dronedetection with RF technology. Our proposed solutions relyon three main sources of wireless signals caused by the drone’srotating propellers,the drone’s communication and drone’sbody vibration.+ Drone detection by analyzing the reﬂected signal fromthe drone’s propellers. In general, the drone is detectedbased on the signature of the signal reﬂected from its pro-pellers, which could be observed by off-the-shelf wirelessreceiver (i.e Wi-Fi receiver or WARP). This proposed sys-tem could be implemented by active approach as illustratedin Figure 1(a). Similar to a radar, a transmitter broadcastsand a receiver captures the reﬂected signals bounced off thedrone. The reﬂected signal is not continuous and its duty cy-cle depends on the rotation speed and size of the propeller,and the distance between the drone and receiver.For example, if the propeller rotates with the speed around7500 to 10500 RPM (as in Bebop ARDrone [19]), we expectto see the signature of the drone on the frequency band lessthan 200Hz. However, the reﬂection capability depends onthe drone orientation and distance with respect to the wire-less receiver. As will be shown in the later experiment (Sec-tion 4), the signal is not fully reﬂected after passing throughthe drone propellers, we found that there is a signiﬁcant dif-ference between scenarios with and without the drone withinthe band of 20th Hz to 30th Hz on the received signal.+ Drone detection by eavesdropping on the communi-cation between the drone and its controller. Technically,the system detects a drone by listening the communicationchannel between the drone and its controller using a wire-less receiver. The proposed system includes a wireless re-ceiver that listens at the drone’s communication frequency18



range. As mentioned in existing literature [26, 14, 12], mostof the drones usually communicate with their controllers fre-quently around 30 times per second to update its status aswell as to receive the commands from controller. Unlike thecommunication channel between access point (AP) and mo-bile devices (mobile phone, tablet, and laptops) at home en-vironment, which usually exchang beacons at every 100ms(10Hz) [16], the drone controller requires higher frequencyof communication to control the drone precisely. Therefore,a system could collect wireless samples and observes the sig-nal at frequency band less than 100Hz, analyses them, anddetects drone’s presence. The preliminary validation of thisidea is presented in Section 4.+ Drone detection by analyzing the vibration patternsof the drone’s body. This method can be implemented us-ing either active or passive approach. In active approach, thesystem sends out a wireless signal and observes the reﬂectedcomponent caused by drone body vibration. In passive ap-proach, the wireless receiver observes the signal overheardfrom the drone communication, and analyzes the receivedsignal caused by drone’s body vibration. More speciﬁcally,the receiver observes the change in reﬂected signal strengthcaused by the drone body’s vibration. The minute distancechanges between the drone and receiver can be estimated onboth received signal strength (RSS) or phase variations. Letdbe the distance between the drone and controller, dbe thedistance variation caused by the drone’s body, then the RSSof the signal can be estimated from the well-known path-lossequation:RSS =G2(d+d),(1)where 0<<1is the reﬂection capability of the drone’sbody, and the gain Gis the attenuation gain of signals dueto round-trip propagation. Then, we can approximate therelationship between RSS and distance change. The ﬂuctua-tion of the RSS represents the change of d. The variationpatterns then would be used to detect the drone. For bet-ter resolution of distance variation detection, we can analyzephase of the received signal. The principle of phase-basedanalysis is inspired from a traditional equation in wirelesstechnology:=2⇡⇥distancewavelength =2⇡⇥(d+d),(2)where be the phase and be the wavelength of the receivedsignal. Then, the variation patterns dcan be observed andanalyzed to detect the drone.4. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATIONIn this section, we conduct a set of controlled experimentsto validate the feasibility of our approaches as well as to de-scribe the related research problems. The experiment setupis shown in Figure 2. In the active approach, we place adrone from 0.5m to 5m away from the wireless transmitterand receiver and collect the data when the drone is ﬂyingand powered off. In the passive approach, a similar setup isused, but the wireless research platform does not emit anysignal and only listens the wireless signal in the vicinity.Both drone and wireless research platform are operating onWiFi 802.11 standard (channel 6, 2.437 GHz) during our ex-periments, and the sampling rate of data collection processis 100kHz.RX(b)Drone(a) TXRXFigure 2: The experiment setup to validate the availabil-ity of the drone by using (a) active and (b) passive ap-proaches.+ Drone detection by analyzing the signal reﬂected offof the drone’s propellers. We validate the feasibility of theproposed approach by analyzing the reﬂected signal strengthon both time and frequency domains when sending a singletone RF signal to the drone. We used a Wireless ResearchPlatform board (WARP [21]) for this approach (Figure 2(a)).0 10 20 30Time (s)00.51AmplitudeReceived Signal Strength10 10.5 11Time (s)00.51AmplitudeReceived Signal Strength10.2 10.3 10.4Time (s)00.51AmplitudeReceived Signal Strength10.205 10.21 10.215 10.22Time (s)00.51AmplitudeReceived Signal StrengthStationaryFly25Hz 2ms(a) (b)(c) (d)Figure 3: The results of observing the reﬂected signalusing the active detection approach.We plot the received signal strength of the signal cap-tured by the active approach as in Figure 3. We display thesignal on different time scales when zooming in the signalstrength from (a) to (d). As can be seen in Figure 3(a), the re-ceived signal strength increases signiﬁcantly when the dronechanges from stationary mode to ﬂying mode (propellers ro-tating). In Figure 3(c), we observe that the effects of thereﬂected signal mostly appeared at low frequency compo-nents (less than 100Hz). We found that the length of eachreﬂected signal varies from 1.4ms to 2ms. From the aboveresults, it is feasible to observe the reﬂected signal from adrone’s propeller on the time domain, and this signal can19



be used to develop an algorithm for drone detection. Wealso found that the difference between stationary and ﬂyingstages of the drone in terms of received signal strength (asillustrated in Figure 3) can be observed clearly when the dis-tance between the drone and the detecting system is less than3m. We are investigating a complete detection algorithm andvalidating it with longer distance.Challenges. We found interesting research problems wheninvestigating on this technique: (a) The drone propeller istoo small, and the disturbance caused by its rotation is dif-ﬁcult to be observed; (b) The angle of the beam directionand the propellers affects the sensitivity of the detection al-gorithm; (c) The drone usually ﬂies with 10m/s making itchallenging to obtain enough wireless disturbance to deducethe drone availability; (d) The communication between thedrone and its controller also creates the effects to the signalat 30th Hz frequency, hence, distinguishing the signal causedby the drone’s communication and the propellers rotation isone of the key challenges.+ Drone detection by eavesdropping on the communi-cation between the drone and its controller. We use USRPEttus B200 board [28] to validate the feasibility of the ap-proach. The setup is illustrated as in Figure 2 (b). As thedrone communicates with its controller frequently around 30times/s [26, 14, 12], by eavesdropping this communicationchannel and observing the frequency range from 20Hz to100Hz, we observe a clear effect from the presence of thedrone from the received signal. Figure 4 (top left) showsthe frequency distribution of the signal by placing a drone5m away from the USRP board. As illustrated in the ﬁg-ure with blue-dotted cycles, there are peaks that can be ob-served at 30th, 60th, and 90th Hz when the drone is ﬂying.Note that there are four main components that might causethose peaks: the motor rotation,the camera feed,the pro-peller rotation, and the communication channel. To conﬁrmthat these peaks are from the communication channel, weisolate each of these components and observe the receivedsignal in frequency domain. We found that the drone’s sig-nature (30th, 60th, 90th Hz peaks) is occurred regardless ofthe availability of motor rotation, camera feed and propellersrotation. Table 1 describes the detailed experimental results.As can be seen from the table, the drone signature is onlyobservable when the communication between the drone andits controller is established. The signature is observable evenwhen we disable the camera, stop the motor, and remove thepropellers.We then conduct two further experiments to answer thekey questions: “How far can the drone’s signature be ob-served?" and “How does the environment affect to the drone’ssignature?". The following discussion describes the answersin details.Impact of Distance Change. We setup an experiment as inFigure 2 (b). We vary the distance from 5m to 50m, and ob-serve the signal in time and frequency domains. The RSSdrastically reduces when the drone is moved from 5m to50m away from the receiver. With the presence of the drone,the RSS is higher than the noise level when the distance isless than 50m. The RSS is close to the noise level when theFrequency (Hz)0 50 100Power (dB)-180-160-140-120-100Power Spectral Density5mNo DroneFrequency (Hz)0 50 100Power (dB)-180-160-140-120-100Power Spectral Density10mNo DroneFrequency (Hz)0 50 100Power (dB)-180-160-140-120-100Power Spectral Density20mNo DroneFrequency (Hz)0 50 100Power (dB)-180-160-140-120-100Power Spectral Density30mNo DroneFrequency (Hz)0 50 100Power (dB)-180-160-140-120-100Power Spectral Density40mNo DroneFrequency (Hz)0 50 100Power (dB)-180-160-140-120-100Power Spectral Density50mNo DroneFigure 4: The frequency distribution of the received sig-nals observed at different distance with the drone usingthe passive detection approach.Drone -ControllerComm.Motor CameraFeedPropeller DroneSignatureNo Off Absent Absent NoYes On Absent Absent YesYes On Absent Present YesYes Off Absent Absent YesYes Off Absent Present YesYes On Present Absent YesYes On Present Present YesYes Off Present Absent YesYes Off Present Present YesTable 1: A summary of experiment setup to validate thesignature of Drone’s communication.distance between the drone and the receiver is around 50m.Moreover, we plotted the collected signal in the frequencydomain as in Figure 4. The signal peaks caused by the com-munication channel are marked as signature peaks at about30th, 60th and 90th Hz inside the dotted blue cycles. Thecharacteristics of the received signal on frequency domainremain similar over different distances. These results are re-peated over 5 testing sessions.So far, we have shown that the drone’s signature can beobserved by eavesdropping on the drone’s communication.However, this signature is sensitive to the distance betweenthe drone and the detecting system. It is challenging to ob-serve the drone’s signature when the distance is around 50mor more. This limitation, however, can be partial solved byincreasing the gain of the receiver’s antenna panel. Note thatwe are currently using an antenna panel that supports verysmall gain (6dBi).Next, we answer the second question mentioned earlier.More speciﬁcally, we want to validate the possibility of thistechnique when changing the testing environment.Impact of Environment Change. To validate the effectsof environmental change, we setup an experiment as in Fig-ure 5, where we control the drone to ﬂy in a downtown city(inside our campus) and in an open ﬁeld (soccer ﬁeld). In the20

Meanwhile, there is only one WiFichannel in the open ﬁeld operating at the drone’s frequencywith -90dB maximum signal strength. The results are shownin Figure 6. As can be seen from the Figure, the higher re-ceived signal strength is obtained in the city environmentbecause the wireless receiver receives data from differentsources beside of the drone. More importantly, both receivedsignal maintain the peaks as can be seen in frequency domain(Figure 6 (right)). The results are repeated during 5 testingsessions. Therefore, these results conﬁrm that the presenceof the drone can also be observed in a city environment.In summary, the preliminary results showed that our methodis very promising for addressing the drone detection prob-lem. The drone can be detected by its signature based on ob-serving the wireless signal in the area that it passes through.Challenges. We also found interesting research problemswhen investigating this technique. The current detection mech-anism relies on the fact that the drone is required to exchangethe information with its controller frequently (30 times/s).This frequency of communication is distinguishable with thefrequency of exchanging beacons between mobile or tabletor laptop and home devices with WiFi AP [16]. However,one can develop an application to communicate with an APat the same frequency as the drone (30Hz). Therefore, we arelooking deeper into the obtained WiFi package of the droneto analyze the key differences between the drone’s commu-nication packages and others. In addition, regarding the im-pact of changing the drone’s ﬂying speed, we need to do fur-ther experiments as it was difﬁcult to obtain the proper ﬂyingspeed from our drone controller during the testing sessions.+ Drone detection by analyzing the movement patternsof the drone’s body. Different values of distance d(in Equa-tions (1) and (2)) give us different maximum magnitudes ofthe received signal strength. In the future, how the patternschange vs. distance (observed by received signal strengthand phase) will be analyzed. The key challenge here is toﬁnd a unique signature on RSS patterns that represents forthe effects from the drone body’s vibration. We also leavethe solution for later investigation.5. RELATED WORKPrior work in drone detection includes the following ap-proaches. First, acoustic signature-based detection has beenemployed for drones. The acoustic signatures of the differ-ent drones in the market are collected into a database [6,5] and compared with the recorded signal to ﬁnd a match.Noisy urban environments with city trafﬁc pose challengesfor using audio for drone detection [4, 10]. Moreover, thedatabase will require constant updating of signatures whennew drone models emerge.Video-based detection methods employ one or more cam-eras to detect a drone. The live video feed’s image is used foranalysis to determine if a drone is present or not. Such video-based approaches require costly compute-intensive hardwareand/or high bandwidth network connections. Further, usingcomputer image processing to discriminate between otherﬂying objects, e.g. birds, and drones is a challenging task [10].For night detection, infrared sensing via a thermal camerawould be needed [1]. The heat emitted from a drone is usedto detect the drone. The effective range to detect humansis around 300m and vehicles is 600m [8]. However, smalldrones don’t produce a lot of heat. One approach combinesaudio and video-based detection, employing a 120-elementmicrophone array and a video camera to detect and trackdrones up to 160 to 250 meters, depending on the type [13].An RF-based detection approach seeks to monitor RF fre-quency ranges 1MHz - 6.8GHz [3]. Any transmitter that isnot known is interpreted as a rogue transmitter or a drone.Such an approach suffers from false positives because un-known RF transmitters are assumed to be a drone even ifthat is not the case.Another technique is radar-based detection. Radio wavesare transmitted and the reﬂection from the object is used toverify if it is a drone or not. X-band frequencies are used forthe surveillance [9]. Doppler processing of the radar pro-vides the velocity of the target and hence enables the de-tection of the small moving objects with a low Radar CrossSection. They are passed through a series of electronic ﬁl-ters to distinguish the drone from all the other moving tar-gets [2]. Our active transmission experiments adopt in spiritthis approach, with a low cost focus. Radar, audio and op-tical cameras were combined to track and discriminate air-borne targets [31].Finally, previous work seeks to detect a drone based onits MAC address. In this method, the Parrot drone is de-tected using the the MAC address along with the individualﬁngerprints determined by nmap for ports 21,23,5551 and21

UAV technologies are developing much faster than means of their control and detection. RADAR technology is one of the means of UAV’s detection. Usually, radars are expensive, and usage of high-power radiation is problematic in many cases. Today’s market provides low cost marine radar working on various principles of operation. Such radar are not optimal, but could be used for UAV detection. Detection possibility of UAVs by FMCW marine radar was investigated by using two types of small UAVs as targets.ViewShow abstract... Another study [96], [97] analyzed 10 seconds of RF signals captured by SDR and found that the RF signatures of commercial Wi-Fi drones can be (1) detected with high accuracy (84.9%) from a distance of 600 meters, and (2) used to identify the detected drone type with variable accuracy (64-89%) depending on the drone. Another study [98] used USRP to detect drones and found that the presence of the drone can also be detected in an urban environment, however it is challenging to observe a drone's RF signature when the drone more than 50 meters away without increasing the gain of the receiver's antenna panel.

We are currently living in an era in which drones are being used for pizza delivery, the shipment of goods, and filming, and they are likely to provide an alternative for transportation in the near future. However, drones also pose a significant challenge in terms of security and privacy within society (for both individuals and organizations), and many drone related incidents are reported on a daily basis. These incidents have called attention to the need to detect and disable drones used for malicious purposes and opened up a new area of research and development for academia and industry, with a market that is expected to reach $1.85 billion by 2024. While some of the knowledge used to detect UAVs has been adopted for drone detection, new methods have been suggested by industry and academia alike to deal with the challenges associated with detecting the very small and fast flying objects. In this paper, we describe new societal threats to security and privacy created by drones, and present academic and industrial methods used to detect and disable drones. We review methods targeted at areas that restrict drone flights and analyze their effectiveness with regard to various factors (e.g., weather, birds, ambient light, etc.). We present the challenges arising in areas that allow drone flights, introduce the methods that exist for dealing with these challenges, and discuss the scientific gaps that exist in this area. Finally, we review methods used to disable drones, analyze their effectiveness, and present their expected results. Finally, we suggest future research directions.ViewShow abstract...

PiNcH is built applying standard classification algorithms to the eavesdropped traffic, analyzing features such as packets inter-arrival time and size. PiNcH does not require either any special hardware or to transmit any signal. Indeed, it is fully passive and it resorts to cheap and general purpose hardware. To evaluate the effectiveness of our solution, we collected real communication measurements from the 3DR SOLO drone, being the most popular open-source hardware, running the widespread ArduCopter open-source firmware, mounted on-board on a wide range of commercial amateur drones. Then, we test our solution against different publicly available wireless traces. The results prove that PiNcH can efficiently and effectively: (i) identify the presence of the drone in several heterogeneous scenarios; (ii) identify the current state of a powered-on drone, i.e., flying or lying on the ground; (iii) discriminate the movement of the drone; and, finally, (iv) estimate a lower bound on the time required to identify a drone with the requested level of assurance. The quality and viability of our solution do prove that network traffic analysis can be successfully adopted for drone identification and pave the way for future research in the area.ViewShow abstract... Several other sensing technologies have been applied for drone detection (radar [5] and other RF-based sensors [6], acoustic sensors [7] and LIDAR [8]). Hybrid approaches have as well been proposed [9].  ...Drone Detection Using Depth MapsPreprintFull-text availableAug 2018 Adrian Carrio Sai H VempralaAndres Ripoll Pascual CampoyObstacle avoidance is a key feature for safe Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) navigation. While solutions have been proposed for static obstacle avoidance, systems enabling avoidance of dynamic objects, such as drones, are hard to implement due to the detection range and field-of-view (FOV) requirements, as well as the constraints for integrating such systems on-board small UAVs. In this work, a dataset of 6k synthetic depth maps of drones has been generated and used to train a state-of-the-art deep learning-based drone detection model. While many sensing technologies can only provide relative altitude and azimuth of an obstacle, our depth map-based approach enables full 3D localization of the obstacle. This is extremely useful for collision avoidance, as 3D localization of detected drones is key to perform efficient collision-free path planning. The proposed detection technique has been validated in several real depth map sequences, with multiple types of drones flying at up to 2 m/s, achieving an average precision of 98.7%, an average recall of 74.7% and a record detection range of 9.5 meters.ViewShow abstractA Robust Phase-Ambiguity-Immune DOA Estimation Scheme for Antenna ArrayConference PaperDec 2018Hua Fu Samith Abeywickrama Chau YuenViewDrone Detection Using Depth MapsConference PaperOct 2018 Adrian Carrio Sai H VempralaAndres Ripoll Pascual CampoyViewDrone Detection and Identification by Using Packet Length SignatureConference PaperJul 2018Pongjarun Kosolyudhthasarn Vasaka VisoottivisethDoudou Fall Shigeru KashiharaViewDrone profiling through wireless fingerprintingConference PaperJul 2017Hualiang LiGarrett JohnsonMaverick Jennings Yingfei DongViewThe estimation algorithm of operative capabilities of complex countermeasures to resist UAVsArticleAug 2018SIMUL-T SOC MOD SIM Igor KorobiichukYuriy DanikOleksyj Samchyshyn Maciej KachniarzThe proposed observation model provides for calculating the probability of detection of different types of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) at a certain range with regard to their tactical and technical characteristics and security equipment capabilities. The comparison of the obtained values of generalized indicators of security equipment use efficiency is based on a specified criterion. To take into account factors that significantly affect a modeling object, calculations are carried out under specified conditions and restrictions. UAVs should be detected until a covering object gets in a swath width given the time required for countermeasures. Based on the software implementation of the algorithm we have evaluated the efficiency of use of hypothetical security equipment for detecting certain types of UAVs, and defined means of further use or improvement.ViewShow abstractShow more802.11 beacons revealed. indexed by web. archive. org onApr 2003J GeierJ.

They have a broad market and applications. However, a powerful technology often has two ethical sides. Miniature drones can be abused, rendering security and privacy concerns. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we will perform a survey of mini-drones on market and compare their specifications such as flight time, maximum payload weight, and price, and regulations and issues of operating mini-drones. Second, we propose novel aerial localization strategies and compare six different localization strategies for a thorough study of aerial localization by a single drone.ViewShow abstractDetection and tracking of drones using advanced acoustic camerasConference PaperOct 2015Joël BussetFlorian Perrodin Peter WelligThomas NussbaumerRecent events of drones flying over city centers, official buildings and nuclear installations stressed the growing threat of uncontrolled drone proliferation and the lack of real countermeasure. Indeed, detecting and tracking them can be difficult with traditional techniques. A system to acoustically detect and track small moving objects, such as drones or ground robots, using acoustic cameras is presented. The described sensor, is completely passive, and composed of a 120-element microphone array and a video camera. The acoustic imaging algorithm determines in real-time the sound power level coming from all directions, using the phase of the sound signals. A tracking algorithm is then able to follow the sound sources. Additionally, a beamforming algorithm selectively extracts the sound coming from each tracked sound source. This extracted sound signal can be used to identify sound signatures and determine the type of object. The described techniques can detect and track any object that produces noise (engines, propellers, tires, etc). It is a good complementary approach to more traditional techniques such as (i) optical and infrared cameras, for which the object may only represent few pixels and may be hidden by the blooming of a bright background, and (ii) radar or other echo-localization techniques, suffering from the weakness of the echo signal coming back to the sensor. The distance of detection depends on the type (frequency range) and volume of the noise emitted by the object, and on the background noise of the environment. Detection range and resilience to background noise were tested in both, laboratory environments and outdoor conditions. It was determined that drones can be tracked up to 160 to 250 meters, depending on their type. Speech extraction was also experimentally investigated: the speech signal of a person being 80 to 100 meters away can be captured with acceptable speech intelligibility.ViewShow abstractA Review of Security Threats of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Mitigation StepsArticleFull-text availableOct 2015 Dinesh SathyamoorthyThe use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has increased exponentially over the last decade for a broad range of applications. The recent commercial availability of a new generation of small UAVs has emphasised the growing threat posed by these machines. This paper is aimed at reviewing the security threats posed by UAVs in areas such as terrorist attacks, illegal surveillance and reconnaissance, smuggling, electronic snooping, and mid-air collisions, in addition to discussing on the categories of UAV intrusions in terms of intention and level of sophistication of the operators. Mitigation steps for UAV intrusions are also discussed, focusing on geofencing, detections systems (radar, and acoustic, radio frequency (RF) emission and electro-optical (EO) sensing), electronic defences (command link jamming and appropriation, and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) jamming and spoofing), and kinetic defences (shooting down UAVs and net capture using interceptor UAVs).ViewShow abstractTowards Detection and Control of Civilian Unmanned Aerial VehiclesConference PaperFull-text availableDec 2013 Matthew PeacockMichael N. JohnstoneConsidering the significant number of non‐military unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that can be purchased to operate in unregulated air space and the range of such devices, the potential for security and privacy problems to arise is significant. This can lead to consequent harm for critical infrastructure in the event of these UAVs being used for criminal or terrorist purposes. Further, if these devices are not being detected, there is a privacy problem to be addressed as well. In this paper we test a specific UAV, the Parrot AR Drone version 2, and present a forensic analysis of tests used to deactivate or render the device inoperative. It was found that these devices are open to attack, which means they could be controlled by a third party.ViewShow abstractApplication-Driven Design of Aerial Communication NetworksArticleMay 2014IEEE COMMUN MAGTorsten Andre Karin Anna Hummel Angela P. Schoellig Siwei ZhangNetworks of micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) equipped with various sensors are increasingly used for civil applications, such as monitoring, surveillance, and disaster management. In this article, we discuss the communication requirements raised by applications in MAV networks. We propose a novel system representation that can be used to specify different application demands. To this end, we extract key functionalities expected in an MAV network. We map these functionalities into building blocks to characterize the expected communication needs. Based on insights from our own and related real-world experiments, we discuss the capabilities of existing communications technologies and their limitations to implement the proposed building blocks. Our findings indicate that while certain requirements of MAV applications are met with available technologies, further research and development is needed to address the scalability, heterogeneity, safety, quality of service, and security aspects of multi- MAV systems.ViewShow abstractUnderstanding the drone epidemicArticleJun 2014Comput Law Secur RepRoger ClarkeDrones are aircraft that have no onboard, human pilot. Through the twentieth century, piloted aircraft made far greater progress than drones. During the twenty-first century, on the other hand, changes in both drone technologies and drone economics have been much more rapid. Particularly in the case of small, inexpensive devices, the question arises as to whether existing regulatory frameworks can cope. To answer that question, it is necessary to document the nature and characteristics of drones, the dimensions across which they vary, the purposes to which they are put, and the impacts that they appear likely to have. The analysis concludes that careful consideration is needed of the adequacy of controls over the impacts of drones on two important values – public safety, and behavioural privacy.ViewShow abstractHacking and securing the AR.Drone 2.0 quadcopter - Investigations for improving the security of a toyConference PaperFull-text availableJan 2014Proceedings of SPIE Johann PlebanRicardo Band Reiner CreutzburgIn this article we describe the security problems of the Parrot AR.Drone 2.0 quadcopter. Due to the fact that it is promoted as a toy with low acquisition costs, it may end up being used by many individuals which makes it a target for harmful attacks. In addition, the videostream of the drone could be of interest for a potential attacker due to its ability of revealing confidential information. Therefore, we will perform a security threat analysis on this particular drone. We will set the focus mainly on obvious security vulnerabilities like the unencrypted Wi-Fi connection or the user management of the GNU/Linux operating system which runs on the drone. We will show how the drone can be hacked in order to hijack the AR.Drone 2.0. Our aim is to sensitize the end-user of AR.Drones by describing the security vulnerabilities and to show how the AR.Drone 2.0 could be secured from unauthorized access. We will provide instructions to secure the drones Wi-Fi connection and its operation with the official Smartphone App and third party PC software.ViewShow abstractDetecting, Tracking, and Identifying Airborne Threats with Netted Sensor FenceChapterJun 2011 Weiqun ShiGus ArabadjisBrett BishopJohn YoderViewShow moreJoin ResearchGate to find the people and research you need to help your work.15+ million members118+ million publications700k+ research projectsJoin for freeRecommendationsDiscover more publications, questions and projects in DronesProjectCapacitive Touch Communication Tam VuView projectProjectOxygen saturation measurement using a smartphone camera.

This problem is likely to expand given the rapid proliferation of drones for commerce, monitoring, recreation, and other applications. A cost-effective detection system is needed to warn of the presence of drones in ... [Show full abstract] such cases. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of inexpensive RF-based detection of the presence of drones. We examine whether physical characteristics of the drone, such as body vibration and body shifting, can be detected in the wireless signal transmitted by drones during communication. We consider whether the received drone signals are uniquely differentiated from other mobile wireless phenomena such as cars equipped with Wi- Fi or humans carrying a mobile phone. The sensitivity of detection at distances of hundreds of meters as well as the accuracy of the overall detection system are evaluated using software defined radio (SDR) implementation.Read moreArticleFull-text availableCost-Effective and Passive RF-Based Drone Presence Detection and CharacterizationFebruary 2018 Phuc Nguyen Hoang Truong Tam Vu[...]Mahesh RavindranathanExcerpted from "Matthan: Drone Presence Detection by Identifying Physical Signatures in the Drone's RF Communication," from MobiSys 2017, Proceedings of the 15th Annual ACM International Conference on Mobile Systems, Applications, and Services, with permission. https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3081354 © ACM 2017.
The rapidly increasing attention regarding drone privacy and security issues ... [Show full abstract] requires a robust solution in both detecting and characterizing unauthorized drones. We have designed a RF-based, cost-effective and passive drone detection system, named Matthan, based on two key physical signatures of the drones, i.e., body shifting and body vibration, in the drone's wireless communication channel. In realizing Matthan, there are many open challenges in wireless sensing and networking, software-defined radio deployment, network synchronization to passively and accurately detect, localize, and characterize drones.View full-textConference PaperDrone Detection and Identification by Using Packet Length SignatureJuly 2018Pongjarun Kosolyudhthasarn Vasaka VisoottivisethDoudou Fall Shigeru KashiharaRead moreConference PaperWi-Fly?: Detecting Privacy Invasion Attacks by Consumer DronesJanuary 2017Simon BirnbachRichard BakerIvan MartinovicRead moreDiscover moreDownload citationWhat type of file do you want?
