 VRMesh Survey
	An advanced  solution for automatic point cloud classification and feature extraction. It automatically classifies vegetation, building roofs, and ground points in LiDAR data or from UAV images. 99% classification jobs can be automatically done with high accuracy. It can also automatically detect building footprints, powerlines, poles, tree crowns, curbs and railways in point clouds. 
Unlike traditional point cloud classification workflows that have to extract ground points first before classifying vegetation and buildings, the first fundamental step in VRMesh Survey is to detect vegetation. The major benefit of our workflow is its unique ability to automatically classify point clouds under extreme variations in terrain, no matter the data is gathered from steep slopes covered with dense vegetation or areas where there is very few ground points available.

Features and Benefits

Adjust LiDAR strips in a simple and fast way
Automatically extract ground points on steep slops
Automatically detect hidden man-made structures
Automatically extract building footprints from dense urban areas
Automatically extract powerlines/poles/tree crowns/railways
Quickly pick a line along a ridge, railway, powerline, road markings, etc.
Provide powerline detection and clearance analysis tools
Provide manual classification tools in a cross-section view
Generate grid surface and export to Esri ASCII Grids

Working Examples:

>> Clean Up and Organize Point Clouds 




>> Extract Powerlines 




>> Trace Road Markings Based on Intensity 




>> Parameter Setting for Large Dataset 




>> LiDAR Strip Adjustment
