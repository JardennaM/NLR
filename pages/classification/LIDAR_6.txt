Adapted Drone Mapping Services for your business needs.
 





 






HomeLiDAR Drafting ServicesDrone LiDAR Services

Drone (UAV) LiDAR Data Processing ServicesDrone mapping are economical alternatives to traditional aerial surveying. Drone survey cover smaller areas of land of up to several square kilometres, construction and development sites. 
With the Drone LiDAR mapping, we perform contours of varying intervals, cut and fill modeling, Digital Elevation Models (DEM), Digital Terrain Models (DTM), Ortho-rectification in combination with imagery, planimetric mapping, slope mapping, and tree height analysis etc. So, depending on your project need, we collect cloud points to produce high-resolution maps and 3D models of natural and man-made objects. 
Our UAV or Drone LiDAR services provide mapping, modeling, point cloud classification, and digital elevation models for any project. 
Benefits of Our Drone LiDAR Service Includes:  

Fast & accurate data acquisition
Remote operation: safer than traditional surveying
Reduces disruptions on infrastructure traffic
Single visit data collection saves cost
Use, or re-use multi-purpose data
3D modeling and design-ready deliverable
Interior and exterior project drawing/mapping

We use drone LiDAR data to give various of our services, like: DEM, DTM, DSM, contours, Ortho mosaic, 3D modeling, and point cloud classification.  
Modelling: With the modelling part mainly 3 types of modelling is performed, Digital terrain modelling(DTM), Digital Elevation Modelling(DEM), Digital Surface modelling(DSM)
3d Modelling: In 3D modelling, a structure is made with x, y, and z coordinates to give a depth to the image. This also enables better visualisation of object or terrain.
Contour: With contour generation, elevation of a terrain is better understandable. A terrain is represented with contour lines of equal elevated places.
Point cloud classification: With point cloud classification, a terrain can be classified with the point cloud data. All the features of a terrain can be classified from the solid earth.
Matching: Most of the time, due to system error the collected data is somewhat distorted. It is of vital necessity to get rid of this error data. We process the various collected point clouds to get the correct data with our LiDAR data matching service where we match the distorted point clouds.
