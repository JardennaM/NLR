Abstract

There is a need for Radio Frequency Signal Classification (RF-Class) toolbox which can monitor, detect, and classify wireless signals. Rapid developments in the unmanned aerial systems (UAS) have made its usage in a variety of offensive as well as defensive applications especially in military, high priority and sensitive government sites. The ability to accurately classify over-the-air radio signals will provide insights into spectrum utilization, device fingerprinting and protocol identification. These insights can help the Warfighter to constantly be informed about adversarys transmitters capabilities without their knowledge. Recently, few researches have proposed feature-based machine learning techniques to classify RF signals. However, these researches are mostly evaluated on simulated environments, less accurate, and failed to explore advance machine learning techniques. In this research, we proposed a feature-engineering based signal classification (RF-class) toolbox which implements RF signal detection, Cyclostationary Features Extraction and Feature engineering, Automatic Modulation Recognition to automatically recognize modulation as well as sub-modulation types of the received signal. To demonstrate the feasibility and accuracy of our approach, we have evaluated the performance on a real environment with an UAS (Drone DJI Phantom 4). Our initial experimental result showed that we were able to detect presence of drone signal successfully when power on and transmitting. And further experiments are under progress.





1.INTRODUCTIONThere is a need for automatic radio frequency (RF) modulation classification which is an intermediate step between spectrum (i.e. signal) detection and demodulation. Implementation of advanced information services and systems such as signal detection and classification are challenging tasks, especially in a non-cooperative crowded environment where various factors like interference, low SNR, fading, phase and frequency offsets cause distortion to the received signal. Signal detection and classification are predominated process in several civilian and military applications such as dynamic spectrum access (DSA), authentication, threat detection etc. In a hostile non-cooperative environment, it is important to detect a primary user signal and demodulate it securely, while simultaneously detecting, jamming and/or modify the intruder signal.Software Defined Radios (SDRs)1 are widely used to develop various civilian and military applications. The SDRs are open source and makes them ideal for implementing a Radio Frequency Signal Classification (RF-Class) toolbox that can monitor, detect, and classify signals. SDRs usually works with variety of communication systems and often reconfigured through transmitted supplementary information. Modern signal transmission systems are intelligent, yielding an increase in the transmission efficiency by reducing the overhead. Such applications have emerged the need for flexible intelligent receiver, where the automatic recognition of the modulation of a detected signal is a major challenging task. Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is an important element that helps to detect and classify the known and/or unknown signal. Due to the non-cooperative nature and real-world scenarios, AMC faces various challenges due to unknown carrier frequency and phase offset, time offset, signal power, multipath fading, frequency selective fading etc.Numerous AMC techniques have been studied for more than a decade and based on that the AMC design involves two phases: Signal Detection and Classification. Signal detection phase performs estimation of signal-to-noise ratio(SNR), signal power etc., whereas classification categorizes signals based on their modulation types and finds sub-modulation types. Due to the usage of various types of digital modulation techniques, it is difficult to select a particular signal detection method and classification technique that is applicable in all scenarios. So, it is needed to design and implement a flexible intelligent Radio Frequency Signal Classification (RF-Class) toolbox.The classification techniques available in RF toolbox are categorized into two different classes of classifiers such as feature-based (FB)2-9 and likelihood-based (LB)10-15 classifiers. The latter is based on the likelihood function of the received signal and the decision is made comparing the likelihood ratio against a threshold. A solution offered by the LB algorithms is optimal in the Bayesian sense, i.e. it minimizes the probability of false classification. The optimal solution suffers from computational complexity, which in many cases of interest naturally gives rise to suboptimal classifiers. In the FB approach, on the other hand, several features are usually employed, and a decision is made based on their observed values. These features are normally chosen in an ad-hoc way. Although a FB-based method may not be optimal, it is usually simple to implement, with near-optimal performance, when designed properly.In recent years, new technologies for wireless communications have emerged. The wireless industry has shown great interest in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, due to the efficiency of OFDM schemes to transmit information in frequency selective fading channels, without complex equalizers.31,32 Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems have also received considerable attention, due to the significant capacity increase they offer. Such emerging technologies in wireless communications have raised new challenges for the designers of signal intelligence and SDR systems, such as, discriminating between OFDM and single carrier modulations,33 identification of signals transmitted from multiple antenna systems, and so on.This report mostly focused on OFDM signal detection, OFDM feature extraction and classification. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we review common approaches in detection and classification. We discuss the design of RF toolbox in Section III. Next in Section IV, we describe the implementation and experimental setup. In section V, we will evaluate our system and explore initial results. Finally, the conclusion and future work is presented in Section VI.2.RELATED WORKSpectrum sensing is the necessary first step in automatic signal classification systems. There are basically three types of spectrum sensing techniques in16 namely, Matched filter detector, Energy detector and Cyclostationary (Feature) detector. Energy detection has been widely implemented due to its simplicity and good performance in high SNR, but it does not provide accurate results for low SNR values. Thus, low SNR environments require more computationally complex methods such as the cyclostationary feature based detector described in.? A crucial part in the performance of an energy detector is the estimation (SNR) of noise. The detection threshold is dynamically changed based on the current channel conditions and SNR are estimated based on adaptive energy detection.18,19 The authors in20,21 studied the performance of both, energy- and cyclostationary based detectors on a GNU Radio1 based test bed using commercially available SDRs such as USRP22 and HackRF. 23The next step after signal detection is AMC and there are many techniques available in the literature. In many applications which implement AMC, the received signal is required some preprocessing such as noise reduction, estimation of carrier frequency, phase offset, signal power etc. before identifying the modulation type and subtype. There are multiple classification techniques used to identify modulation type of the received signal.24 The classification techniques used in AMC broadly categorized into two different classes of classifiers such as feature-based (FB) and likelihood-based (LB) classifiers. The well-designed FB classifiers have the advantage of simple implementation, low computational complexity and optimal performance. On the other hand, the LB classifiers are based on Bayesian probability functions i.e. estimation of the likelihood probability of the received signal is based on assumption that the conditional probability density function of the received signals modulation type is available. The LB approach is computationally complex and optimal in Bayesian sense i.e. the signal features must be independent of each other.Although most of the proposed AMC techniques provide a solution to classify a subset of modulation schemes used today, there is a need to classify a wide range of modulation schemes including the modern emerging modulation types used communication systems such as unmanned aircraft system (UAS), drones. So, the RF-Class toolboxs features will aid in detect and classify UAS signals, which are captured in high/low SNR regimes to create a library of known UAS signals. For every detected signal, RF-Class toolbox will also identify the modulation parameters and the decoded packet structure. This information can be used to craft a waveform and launch a protocol attack on the adversarial UAS signal. The RF-Class toolboxs ability to detect signal energy, automatic modulation recognition and classification will be useful for C-UAS (Center for Unmanned Aircraft Systems) efforts.3.DESIGN OF RF-CLASS FRAMEWORKApproach The accurate recognition of modulation schemes is critical for RF signal classification. The critical challenge lies in extracting signal properties in real time and analyzing them accurately to lead to recognize correct modulation scheme. The classification schemes need to be resilient to receiver noise and fading effects. The extraction of cyclostationary features can be conducted by analyzing autocorrelation and spectral correlation function in GNURadio using existing filter blocks. We will evaluate the effectiveness of this process in both low and high SNR environments. Energy Detection (ED) is optimal if both the signal and the noise are Gaussian but does not perform very well when the noise power is not perfectly known. Feature detection (FD) has better performance than energy detection under low SNRs and is robust to noise uncertainty, however, it requires prior information of the transmitted signal and its complexity and sensing time can sometimes become prohibitive. We propose a hybrid and FD are good choices for hybrid sensing technique that will employ ED for fast coarse sensing followed by a FD for fine sensing.Fig. 1 depicts the overall design of the RF-class frame tool which comprises of the receiver, signal management, and automatic modulation block. Each block will be achieved using the available or customized signal block in GNU radio companion. The receiver block RX is the RF signal receive module. There are different SDRs available commercially that can be used as a receiver, in our research we will be using a USRP board and or HackRF. Additional USRP will be configured as a signal transmitter, random signal at different modulation will be transmitted for testing purpose.Figure 1.RF-class tool Framework.In the signal management block, spectrum sensing and energy detection of signal to be classified will be achieved. There are different detection methods, for our task we have chosen energy detection method due to its complexity and the fact that it does not require prior information of the signal to be classified.The AMC block is where signal modulation will be performed. some pre-processing which may include noise reduction, estimation of center frequency, phase offset and signal power is usually applied on the received signal samples before identifying the modulation types. Based on the signal feature of the signal a decision will be made which will classify the received RF signal.3.1Design of Signal Management block for RF-class FrameworkThe signal management block will comprise of the signal detection, signal assignment and signal extraction modules are shown in Fig. 2.Figure 2.Signal management block for RF-Class.3.1.1Signal detectionFor signal intelligence to be possible, spectrum sensing and signal detection is an important first step. Signal detection can also be challenging due to a number of factors. Firstly, the sensing problem can be severely complicated by multipath fading and time dispersion of wireless channels. Secondly, the required SNR for detection uncertainty may arise due to changing levels of noise or interference with time and location. There are a number of spectrum sensing approach like energy-based detection, cyclostationary based detection, matched filter detection, wavelet detection, and filter bank-based detection. We will use Energy detection spectrum sensing approach in the realization of this task. Primary reasons for choosing this approach: (a) It was assumed that very limited prior information is present on the PU signal, (b) Low complexity of execution which would ultimately make the final design of the cognitive radio simple.Energy Detection is a non-coherent detection technique where the presence of primary signal (PU) is estimated by comparing the received signal energy with a known threshold derived from noise statistics. In time domain, the sensing mechanism is based on the following hypotheses:where h and s[n] are the channel impulse response and target signal respectively, w[n] is additive white Gaussian noise and i[n] represents other sources of interference; thus, the equivalent noise observed at the antenna input is expressed by w′[n].To determine whether the channel is active or not the energy of the received signal is compared to a predetermined threshold. The threshold can also be designed to be adaptive by automatically comparing signal with some statistics value. As shown in the Fig. 3, the processing starts by converting the received signal to the digital domain by the analog to digital converter ADC. The ADC in our case will be USRP or HackRf hardware. After that, Fast Fourier Transform FFT is done and the square of the magnitude of each FFT sample is calculated. Finally, to make the measurement more accurate, average of N number of samples is used to make the decision on the presence or absence of the signal.Figure 3.Energy detection diagram.Threshold plays an important role in detecting the presence of signal. Due to the non-cooperative nature of the channel, it is required to update Threshold value based on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as shown in Fig. 4. When using amplitude or power as the amplitude-squared of the same signal, the resulting decibel level is exactly the same. So, a complex to magnitude square block is used. Most often, amplitude or power spectra are shown in the logarithmic unit decibels (dB). Using this unit of measure, it is easy to view wide dynamic ranges; that is, it is easy to see small signal components in the presence of large ones. So, a Logarithmic (Base 10) block is used.Figure 4.Updating Threshold based on SNR.We will design a custom test statistics block that will perform the following: Total power in N samples setTo make the decision if signal is present or absent, we need to determine the Threshold,where μ and σ are the mean and standard deviation of the time averaged FFT points respectively, Q−1() represents the inverse Q-function and Pfa is the probability that the detection module chooses H1 while the correct decision is H0. The decision rule can be defined asThe “best” estimator to use depends on the given application. The best SNR estimators that performed well in this research are Squared Signal-to-Noise Variance (SNV) Estimator and Second- and Fourth-Order Moments (M2M4) Estimator.253.1.2Signal Assignment and ExtractionThe assignment module assigns signal based on the energy detection result which is made after comparison with the threshold, if signal is present the detection module will estimate center frequency and bandwidth of all detected signals and put them in a queue. The assignment module assesses the queue and match with signal information made available in the data library.The signal extraction modules perform necessary pre-processing to extract the desired signal features and encapsulates the data which will be arranged into frames. The frames output will be passed to the automatic modulation block. Signal assignment and extraction will be achieved using python programming language.3.2Design of Automatic Modulation ClassificationFig. 5 depicts the design of Automatic Modulation Classification blocks. RF-Class’s modulation recognition block will classify based on extracted cyclostationary features. This work will implement recognition of PSK, FSK, QAM, OFDM schemes.Figure 5.Automatic Modulation Classification.After the signal features are extracted the signal is passed to the modulation recognition block for classification. In literature Automatic modulation classification are grouped into 2 categories, likelihood based(LB) and feature based(FB). We plan to implement a multi-level modulation which will make use of both approaches in order to maximize the use of the available classification techniques. The signal management block will estimate the SNR of the detected signal during preprocessing while the SNR is above a predetermined threshold the first level of classification which is the Feature base(FB) will be used for classification. The signal management will switch to level 2 classifier in the case where the SNR is low, likelihood base approach will be employed for this purpose.3.2.1Data and statistical libraryThe signal extraction block performs feature extraction of the received signal. The extracted features are stored as training dataset. The library encompasses various classifier formulas and classifier models corresponding to different classification techniques, estimated on signal features collected as training dataset and other values such as detection thresholds with associated frame numbers, decisions made etc. The data library feeds updated data to the SRM as well as AMC to help those make a decision on the detection and classification techniques to be used for each frame/test data is processed. Depending on the application the framework is used for, specific features are defined, and the classification models are updated as the system performs detection and classification. This statistical block will compute metrics like Pcc, Pd, false alarm rate, and provide graphical representation of the performance.3.2.2Feature based approachFeatures are extracted from received signal and then applied to a classifier in order to recognize the modulation type and possibly its order. There are number of features which has been proposed and used in literature for modulation classification of which the most commonly used are instantaneous amplitude, phase, frequency, statistical features such as higher order and cummulants. The classifier will make use of the extracted features to identify signal modulation by applying a fixed threshold. if features are carefully set this approach provides a more robust and offer low processing complexity. For the first level classifier the feature that will be used for classification is the maximum centered instantaneous amplitude of the received signal.4.IMPLEMENTATION AND ENVIRONMENT SETUPIn this section, we describe the implementation of RF-class toolbox using open-source signal processing software called GNU radio [1]. GNU radio is a commonly used framework to program various software defined algorithms that incorporate the HackRF. GNU radio comprises of various signal processing and digital communication blocks which are used to implement transmit and receive chains for various digital modulation schemes. As shown in Fig. 6, the experimental setup consists of two Linux based hosts, two HackRFs used, one as primary receiver (RX) and other one as transmitter (TX) during our initial experiment.Figure 6.Experimental Setup.4.1Signal Transmit flow graphRandom signal is generated and transmitted using HackRf on one host computer. In our initial GNU radio-based Energy detection module implements transmission and reception of OFDM modulated signal. Fig. 7 is the transmission flow graph to be used in generating a signal at different frequency range. For testing purpose HackRf was used and OFDM signal centered at 677 MHz was transmitted.Figure 7.OFDM Signal Transmit.4.2Energy Detection (receiver) flow graphThe Transmitted signal is received using HackRf and the setup on another computer. Fig. 8 shows the receiver flow graph where the energy detection of the signal transmitted is performed. The Osmocom source is the HackRF where some parameters such as sample rate, frequency and bandwidth are configured. The received signal data is processed in the computer where the GNU radio is installed. The throttle block is used to control the CPU usage of the computer. The signal received is converted into a vector of 1024 points using the stream to Vector block. At the same time, the output is plotted using the QT GUI Sink block for reference purpose. This has power spectral density (PSD), Waterfall, Time Domain, and Constellation displays. Following the conversion to 1024 points is the FFT block. The FFT block performs fast Fourier transform on the incoming stream of data and the output is sent to complex to mag˄ 2. Windowing is also done in this block in order to minimize edge effects and prevent spectral leakage in the FFT spectrum. Blackman Harris window was chosen for windowing purpose. Next is removal of the scaling made by the FFT block itself. Then, the magnitude of the complex value is squared (a ± jb ⇒ a2 + b2) by the complex to mag˄2. The output of this block is then sent to the custom-made Energy_detection_ff block which is where the detection algorithm is implemented. The block allows user to choose the number of samples and the probability of false alarm to be used for calculation. From the input data, the block calculates the mean (average), variance and standard deviation of the received signal. These parameters are also used to calculate the dynamic threshold for signal detection. The average signal energy is then compared with the threshold to determine if the signal is present or not. If the signal energy is greater than the threshold then signal is present, and the signal energy is sent to the output. The QT GUI Sink block is used to display of the power of the received signals in the frequency domain for visualization.Figure 8.Signal receiver with energy detection custom block.4.3Signal Feature ExtractionFeature extraction typically the first stage in AMC systems. Given signal set to be classified, the feature parameters of different classes of signal and rules for the classifier should be determined first. To achieve better classification performance, the selected features should be insensitive to SNR variations. The cyclostationary features of the signal are extracted through spectral correlation analysis.This research is initially focusing on classifying Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulated signals. OFDM signal classification is based on parameters such as center frequency, OFDM symbol duration, CP length, and number of subcarriers.? Cyclostationary Feature based OFDM classification27 considers Frame Preamble Cyclostationary Signature, Pilot Subcarrier Cyclostationary Signature. Authors of28 reported that the OFDM Modulation classification parameters are number of carriers, symbol duration, Bandwidth and Bit rate. The authors in29 used the following OFDM modulation classification parameters Carrier frequency, Total bandwidth, Number of subcarriers, Subcarrier spacing (Δf), Length of cyclic prefix (CP), Sampling period, OFDM Frame duration (CP included).4.3.1OFDM Key Parameters1. textitCyclic Prefix Length Determination: The useful symbol length (Tu) is inverse of the subcarrier spacing Δf. Then, the CP length is (Tg = G * Tu), where G is (Tg/Tu) ratio. The choice of G is made according to channel parameters. The total OFDM symbol length consists of the useful symbol length and the CP length (ToFDM = Tg + Tu).302. Number of Subcarriers : (Pilot and data subcarriers)3. FFT size : 64, 128, …4. OFDM Symbol duration: Inverse of subcarrier5. Subcarrier Spacing: Δf = 1/Ts, where Ts symbol time4.3.2Implementation of OFDM parameter estimationBelow are the steps followed:1. Calculate the autocorrelation function and then estimate FFT length (subcarriers).(a) discrete autocorrelationR discrete autocorrelation at lag l for a discrete-time signal y(n).(b) The easiest way to describe the CAF (cyclic autocorr function) is that it is a coefficient in the Fourier series expansion of the time-varying autocorrelation of a cyclostationary random process (cyclosta-tionary signal).where  is a Fourier-series coefficient called the cyclic autocorrelation function, the Fourier frequencies a are called cycle frequencies (CFs), τ lag parameter, andand2. Calculate time variant autocorrelation and cyclic correlation function.3. Calculate cyclic prefix length.4. Calculate subcarrier spacing, symbol time.5.AUTOMATIC MODULATION CLASSIFICATIONAutomatic modulation classification tool uses different machine learning classifier modules to perform classification. Currently, gnu-Radio doesnt any in-build machine learning modules that can be used out of the box. Fortunately, gnu-Radio supports python and there are numerous machine learning libraries available in python.AMC is implemented using GnuRadio OOT blocks for machine learning “training” and “testing”. The ML-Training block as shown in fig. 9, allows to configure two parameters such as data_path and model_name. The first parameter is an absolute path to the training data (assumed here that training dataset is already formatted to features and class labels, typically into x_train and y_train). Then the second parameter is name of the machine learning algorithm to be used to create the training model (e.g. “LinearReg”, “LR” for logistic regression, “DT” for decision tree,“RF”-Random forest, etc). The ML-Training block creates and saves the training model to a directory “ML-Models” so that ML-Test block will use it later stage.Figure 9.ML_training Block(left), Block Properties(right).Fig. 10 depicts the ML_Testing block that allows to configure two parameters such as data_path and model_name to be used. The first parameter is an absolute path to the testing data (assumed here that testing dataset is already formatted to features and class labels, typically into x_test and y_test).Figure 10.ML_testing Block(left), Block Properties(right).5.1Practical AMC FrameworkAs our initial focus is on OFDM modulated signal classification and setting up an experimental environment is more important and shown in fig. 11.Figure 11.AMC Environment Setup for OFDM.5.1.1OFDM parameter estimationThis section describes how to capture OFDM parameters at receiver end while the drones (DJI Phantom 4 and DJI Mavic Pro) are transmitting. We use a custom block “ofdm_param_estimator” and a QT sink block from to capture key parameters from the transmitted signal. We will collect the parameters while the drones are transmitting. The collected parameters are then used to construct training data sets. The training dataset is constructed from the measurements when each drone is transmitting, no drone is transmitting and both the drones are transmitting. In this research the parameters such as subcarrier spacing, Symbol duration, Cyclic Prefix length, FFT length, Signal average, Threshold are measured and used as features for the classification process. Fig. 12 shows the OFDM parameter estimation blocks.Figure 12.OFDM Parameter Estimation and Signal Classification.5.1.2Feature-Based classificationThe AMC framework includes ML_Tesing block as shown in fig. 12 to conduct a binary classification between OFDM signals transmitted by the drones. Classifiers such as decision tree, support-vector machine, Naive Bayes etc. are used and measured the classification accuracy.6.RESULTS6.1Energy Detection BlockThis section represents effectiveness of energy detection block in presence of noise and how gain affects the detected signal at the receiver. It is observed that the signal is present at some frequency ranges as we can see in both the reference sink and the custom energy detector sink in all the test scenarios and test cases considered below. The transmitted and received signals are shown in fig. 13 and fig. 14 respectively.Figure 13.Transmitted Signal.Figure 14.Received Signal.6.1.1Different gain test of the Energy Detection BlockIt is known that signal to noise ratio (SNR) is very important in relation to the performance of signal processing. The power of the system is an important factor to achieving SNR for testing. The gain of the transmitter and receiver are varied at different and observations are noted.The RF Gain value of the osmocom source at the receiver flow graph was varied to test the SNR. The osmocom sink at the transmit flow graph RF gain is constant at 20 dB. The receiver osmocom source properties shown in fig. 15. The receiver RF gains at 20dB, 10dB are shown in fig. 16 and fig. 17 respectively.Figure 15.Receiver Osmocom properties.Figure 16.Receiver RF Gain = 20.Figure 17.Receiver RF Gain = 10.6.2Drone Signal ClassificationThe classification results are based on 5000 data samples. Table 1 shows the drone detection accuracy along with correct and wrong prediction counts. Fig. 18 shows the drone detection rate. Table 2 shows the received energy level in dB at the receiver end. Fig. 19 shows the SNR plot in dB.Table 1.Shows the result of test conducted to determine the drone detection under low SNR at different distances from receiver.No. of smaples = 5000DistanceDetection rateCount of Wrong predictionsCount of Correct predictionsless than 5 m0.98189149095 m0.888560444010 m0.8462769423120 m0.8134933406750 m0.716214193581greater than 50 m0.560421982802Figure 18.Statistics of Drone detection.Table 2.Margins and print area specifications.DistanceEnergy(dB)Less than 5 m105 m910 m-1020 m-2550 m-30greater than 50 m-45Figure 19.Estimated Signal/Energy Detection Level.7.CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKAs we have observed that energy detection block is implemented using GnuRadio and HackRF. At some frequency ranges the signal presence are observed in both the reference sink and the custom energy detector sink. The signal feature extraction is also implemented, and key parameters are extracted from OFDM modulated signals successfully. Automatic modulation classification blocks implemented and tested successfully but need further improvements on adding more features, implementing feature engineering and more test cases must be evaluated. Also, different modulated signals will be evaluated in future.REFERENCES[1] GNURadio, https://www.gnuradio.org/doc/doxygen/index.htmlGoogle Scholar
