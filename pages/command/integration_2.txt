Announcing Drone 1.1.0



							bradrydzewski
						

April 23, 2019



Drone 1.1.0 is now available. This minor release comes just weeks after the official 1.0 release and includes a number of small features and improvements. See the project CHANGELOG.md for more details. Notable features are highlighted below.
Breaking Changes
None.
Organization Secrets
Organization secrets can be used to provide global secrets to all repositories in an organization, and can simplify secret management. Organization secrets are managed from the command line. Note that we plan to add secret management screens to the user interface in the coming weeks.
drone orgsecret add [command options] [organization] [name] [data]

Example organization secret commands:
$ drone orgsecret add github docker_username octocat
$ drone orgsecret add github docker_password swordfish
$ drone orgsecret list github

docker_password 
Organization:       github
Pull Request Read:  false
Pull Request Write: false

docker_username 
Organization:       github
Pull Request Read:  false
Pull Request Write: false

Example configuration using global organization secrets:
---
kind: pipeline
name: default

steps:
- name: publish
  image: plugins/docker
  settings:
    repo: hello-world
    tags: latest
    username:
      from_secret: docker_username
    password:
      from_secret: docker_password

...
Cron Filters
Cron filters are used to limit execution of a pipeline or pipeline step based on the cron job that triggered the build. This is useful when you need different execution logic per cron job.
---
kind: pipeline
name: default

steps:
- name: test
  image: golang
  commands:
  - go test -v
  - go build

- name: deploy
  image: plugins/docker

    repo: hello-world
    tags: latest

trigger:
  cron: [ weekly ]
