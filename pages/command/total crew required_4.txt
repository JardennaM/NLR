                    Operational Suitability Data (OSD) for flight crew (FC)                   




        
            
                What is the content and purpose of the EASA type rating and licence endorsement lists?            



 Two separate EASA type rating and licence endorsement lists - flight crew are published by EASA (one for helicopters and one for all other aircraft): Type Ratings and Licence endorsement lists.
These lists constitute the class and type of aircraft categorisations in accordance with definitions of category of aircraft, class of aeroplane, and type of aircraft and paragraph FCL.700 and GM1 FCL.700 of Annex I (Part-FCL) to Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011.  
The lists also indicates if operational suitability data (OSD) for flight crew are available. EASA type certificate data sheets (TCDSs) and the list of EASA supplemental type certificates contain further references to OSD. Complete current OSD information is held by the relevant type certificate (TC) or supplemental type certificate (STC) holder.
Furthermore, the lists provide aircraft-specific references relevant to flight crew qualifications and air operations, including references to (non-OSD) documents, such as (J)OEB reports or Operational Evaluation Guidance Material (OE GM).
Explanatory notes for these lists are found at the same website location.

                Why do the EASA type rating and licence endorsement lists not contain references to the latest applicable version of an OSD FC document?            



 The EASA type rating and licence endorsement lists indicate whether an OSD FC document for a relevant aircraft exists. OSD FC documents are certification documents which are held and maintained by TC/STC Holder and are subject to Annex I to Commission Regulation No 748/2012 (Part-21) provisions. Consequently, changes to OSD are handled in accordance with Part-21 procedures in the same way that e.g. changes to aeroplane flight manual (AFM’s) are dealt with. This includes the principle of delegation of privileges to DOAs based on which minor changes to OSD FC are approved under DOA privileges.
The responsibility of tracking the OSD FC document version resides therefore with the TC/STC holder and referencing that in the TR and licence endorsement list could potentially generate inconsistencies.
Users should consider establishing a process to ensure the regular receipt of OSD FC updates, similarly to what might exist for holding current AFM and quick reference handbook (QRH) documents.

                Are ODR tables available as part of the operational suitability data (OSD) for flight crew (FC) document?            



 ODR tables which have been established as part of an OSD FC operational evaluation, are part of the OSD FC data, approved under the type certificate (TC)/ supplemental type certificate (STC) and owned by the TC/STC holder. These ODR tables are original equipment manufacturer OEM generic and must be customized for use by operators to their specific aircraft configurations.
Such ODR tables should therefore be requested directly from the TC/STC holder which has an obligation according to Part-21 to make OSD FC documents available to users.

                When should changes to OSD FC provisions be implemented by users to take into account any revised mandatory elements included in a revision?            



 Article 9a of Commission Regulation No 1178/2011 (amended by Commission Regulation No 70/2014) contains a 2 year transition period for the implementation after initial publication of OSD FC report. This allows training providers, such as ATOs and operators time to adapt their training programmes and provide additional training if needed.
Pilot training courses which were approved before the approval of the OSD FC data should contain the mandatory elements not later than 18 December 2017 or within 2 years after the OSD FC was approved, whichever is later.
Implementation of changes to the OSD FC into existing approved training courses should be implemented within a reasonable timeframe following the OSD change. This timeframe is not clearly defined within the aircrew regulation, however a timeframe of 3 months (or 90 days as under the air ops requirements for an MEL) is considered reasonable.

                What is the status of non-mandatory items in the OSD FC? How should users proceed if deviating from non-mandatory items in the OSD FC?            



 The data contained in OSD FC documents are identified as either ‘mandatory’ or ‘non-mandatory’ elements. While mandatory elements have the status of a rule, non-mandatory elements have the status of Acceptable Means of Compliance (AMC). 
In order to provide some flexibility to users, non-mandatory elements typically address such items as training devices, training duration, previous experience, or currency. In line with the general principles for AMCs, these elements are non-binding provisions established as a means of compliance with the Aircrew Requirements.
Users may choose Alternative Means of Compliance (AltMoC) to use alternatives to the OSD-FC non-mandatory parts by following the dedicated process for AltMoCs described in the implementing rules for aircrew licensing and air operations. Further details on the AltMoC process can be found on EASA's website.

                What aspects should be considered when substituting a training level or device described in the OSD FC by another training level or device?            



 The data approved in the OSD FC are linked to the minimum training syllabus for a pilot type rating. An evaluation of differences (e.g. for aircraft modifications or between variants) identifies minimum training levels and associated training devices, if required. 
With regard to the acquisition of knowledge through theoretical training, some elements may be validated as Level A and can be adequately addressed through self-instruction, whereas other elements may require aided instruction and are identified as Level B. Training organisations may find it more practical to combine Level A and Level B elements into one module of the higher level (such as computer-based training or instructor-led sessions).
With regard to the acquisition of skills through practical training, the OSD FC minimum syllabus identifies elements requiring Level C, D or E practical training and these elements are usually associated in the OSD FC document with specified training devices. 
In principle, the devices described in the OSD FC document and the devices used in pilot training should be of the same training level. The use of a more complex device requires additional considerations, regarding the capabilities and characteristics of the device and the impact this may have on the training objective(s).
As an example, the OSD FC may refer to an FMS desktop trainer for Level C training. FMS training in an FTD, an FFS (without motion or vision) or in the aircraft (static, on power) may provide the same training objectives. However, the more complex training environment introduces elements which may affect the focus of the training, the time required, or other factors and these should be taken into consideration.
The same principles apply for the substitution of an FTD. To replicate the characteristics of an FTD Level I with an FTD Level II, to replicate an FTD Level I with an FFS (without motion or vision), or to replicate an FTD Level II with an FFS (without motion or vision) require different considerations to preserve achievement of the training objective.

                How can I get access to OSD FC documents?            



 
	Contrary to Operational Evaluation Board (OEB) reports which were owned and published by EASA, OSD documents are certification documents which are held by the TC/STC Holder within the framework of Annex I to Commission Regulation No 748/2012 (Part-21). 

	Paragraph 21.A.62 of Part-21 establishes requirements for the owner of the data (type certificate (TC)/supplemental type certificate (STC) holder) on making these OSD data available. It reads as follows:
21.A.62 Availability of operational suitability data
	The holder of the type-certificate or restricted type-certificate shall make available: 
(a) at least one set of complete operational suitability data prepared in accordance with the applicable operational suitability certification basis, to all known EU operators of the aircraft, before the operational suitability data must be used by a training organisation or an EU operator; and 
(b) any change to the operational suitability data to all known EU operators of the aircraft; and 
(c) on request, the relevant data referred to in points (a) and (b) above, to: 
1. the competent authority responsible for verifying conformity with one or more elements of this set of operational suitability data; and 
	2. any person required to comply with one or more elements of this set of operational suitability data.

	Consequently, users should request OSD data from the relevant owner, when required. 

	To assist users in contacting the relevant owner of the document, EASA provides some information on its website for OSD, in particular an OSD contact list based on feedback from manufacturers.

                    Licensing                  




        
            
                How can a national pilot licence be converted into a Part-FCL licence?            



 Existing national pilots licences will be converted in accordance with Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 on Aircrew and its amending Commission Regulation (EU) No 290/2012.
JAR-compliant licences issued or recognised by the Member State before the applicability of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 on Aircrew shall be deemed to have been issued in accordance with this Regulation, and shall be replaced with a Part-FCL licence by 8 April 2018 at the latest.
Non-JAR-compliant licences, including any associated ratings, certificates, authorisations and/or qualifications issued or recognised by the Member State before applicability of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 on Aircrew shall be converted into Part-FCL licences by the Member State that issued the licence in accordance with the provisions of Annex II to that Regulation or the requirements laid down in a conversion report.
As stated in Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 on Aircrew, the application date was 8 April 2012, though flexibility was introduced via transition measures contained in Article 12 of Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 on Aircrew and Article 1 paragraph (6) of Regulation (EU) No 290/2012.

                What is the difference between the terms FCL (Flight Crew Licensing) and Aircrew?            



 Aircrew is the common term for "Flight Crew" and "Cabin Crew".
	The new Implementing Rules cover both flight crew and cabin crew, and were published as Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 laying down technical requirements and administrative procedures related to civil aviation aircrew and its amending Commission Regulation (EU) No 290/2012.
Annex I to the above-mentioned Regulation on Aircrew contains Implementing Rules for Flight Crew (Part-FCL).
Annex V to this Regulation on Aircrew contains Implementing Rules for Cabin Crew (Part-CC).

                Will a licence issued in accordance with JAR-FCL requirements still be valid once the new rules become applicable?            



 Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 on Aircrew contains transition measures to ensure that JAR-FCL licences issued by Member States in accordance with JAR-FCL requirements and procedures will be grandfathered.
This means that holders of JAR compliant pilots' licences can continue to exercise the privileges of their licences after Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 on Aircrew applies, without the need for any further administrative procedures, but these licences shall be replaced with Part-FCL licences by 8 April 2018 at the latest. Further information can be found in paragraph 3 of Article 1 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 290/2012 on Aircrew (which amends the date of 8 April 2017 as stated in paragraph 1 of Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011).
Please note that Member States are not forced to replace valid JAR pilots' licences before the end of their validity period as these licences will be deemed to have been issued under the Part-FCL requirements.

                Will a national licence that does not comply with JAR-FCL requirements still be valid once the new rules become applicable?            



 Once Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 on Aircrew becomes applicable in a certain Member State, it will no longer be possible to fly with a licence that does not comply with those requirements (except in the case of aircraft included in Annex II to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, according to Article 4(5)). 
	Consequently, a national licence will need to be converted into a Part-FCL licence. To deal with those licences issued by Member States in accordance with national rules deviating from JAR-FCL, transition measures have been established in Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 on Aircrew. These transition measures foresee a certain amount of time to convert the national licences into fully compliant Part-FCL licences.
As stated in Article 12 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 on Aircrew, the application date is 8 April 2012, though by way of derogation from this paragraph, Member States may decide not to apply the provisions of Annex I related to pilot licences of powered-lift aircraft, balloons, airships and sailplanes until 8 April 2015. 
	Member States may also decide not to convert non-JAR-compliant aeroplane and helicopter licences that they have issued until 8 April 2014.

	Non-JAR compliant national licences may be converted into Part-FCL licences by the competent authority as follows:
for aeroplanes and helicopters, in accordance with the requirements of Annex II to Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 on Aircrew ;
for other categories of aircraft, on the basis of a conversion report drawn up by the competent authority.

                Could the Agency assist with interpreting the JAR-FCL requirements?            



 JAR-FCL was drafted to harmonise European regulations on flight crew licensing in order to facilitate mutual recognition of licences and ratings. However, the Joint Aviation Requirements (JAR) (see the JAA publications) have been implemented under national law and under the full responsibility of each Member State.
Therefore the Rulemaking Directorate is not in the position to interpret or make comments on JAR-FCL requirements. In addition, please note that the Agency cannot intervene in cases where the national JAR text deviates from the original.
The national aviation authorities are responsible for interpreting and implementing JAR-FCL requirements.
	We therefore recommend that for assistance in interpreting the JAR-FCL requirements, the national aviation authorities should be contacted directly.
A list of the national aviation authorities can be found here.

                Is it correct that there are new requirements for instrument ratings (IR) and provisions to allow cloud flying for sailplane pilots published in the Aircrew Regulation?            



 Yes, this is correct.
On 3 April 2014 Commission Regulation 245/2014 and Agency ED Decision 2014/022/R entered into force. This Regulation and associated AMC/GM include a new competency-based instrument rating (CB IR) and an en route instrument rating (EIR) for private (PPL(A)) and commercial pilot (CPL(A)) licence holders, and a sailplane cloud flying rating.
The new provisions establish a more accessible IR enabling more European General Aviation (GA) pilots to obtain such rating, thereby increasing safety by reducing the number of potential controlled flights into terrain (CFIT). Moreover, the proposed CB IR course will contain a reduced theoretical knowledge (TK) syllabus appropriately reflected by a different level of TK examinations and a reduced amount of instrument flight instruction time when compared with the existing IR courses. Furthermore, the EIR requires less training, but nevertheless consists of more comprehensive flight training when compared to the basic instrument flight module of the existing IR. As the EIR only provides en route IFR privileges, this rating serves as a stepping stone towards the IR through the proposed competency-based route. Both CB IR and EIR include provisions for crediting a certain amount of instrument flight time on aeroplanes outside of an ATO, such as instrument flight time under instruction, prior pilot-in-command (PIC) instrument flight time, including crediting provisions for third-country IR holders.
The cloud flying rating for sailplane pilots allows holders to enter clouds whilst taking into account the airspace structure, the required minima in different airspace categories, and the relevant Air Traffic Control (ATC) procedures.

                Following the introduction of a new variant to an existing type rating, how do pilots attain the privileges to operate the new variant?            



 Licensing following the introduction of a new variant to an existing type rating.
		When a new variant of a type is introduced the existing type endorsement in the pilot licence may remain unchanged but valid for all variants as included in the ‘EASA Type Rating & License Endorsement List Flight Crew’ published on the Agency’s web page. The new endorsement should be added by the pilot’s competent authority at the next routine licensing action or at the request of the pilot in accordance with ARA.FCL.220 (a).
		 
Exercise of the licence privileges in the new variant.
		The pilot must receive differences training or familiarisation as appropriate in accordance with FCL.710. This would mean the pilot has to undergo a differences training course under the responsibility of a qualified instructor and have it confirmed with the instructor’s signature in the pilot’s logbook.
		 
Qualification of pilots, instructors and examiners for the new variant:
		 
Pilots holding a type rating intending to operate the new variant should receive differences training in accordance with FCL.710. This differences training is to be recorded in the pilot’s logbook and signed by a qualified instructor.
				 
Instructors holding instructor privileges as a TRI or SFI on the existing type intending to use their instructor privileges also on the new variant should qualify in accordance with either FCL.900(b) (special conditions for the introduction of a new type) or with (a) above (differences training on the new variant).
				 
Examiners holding examiner privileges as a TRE or SFE on the existing type intending to use their examiner privileges also on the new variant should qualify in accordance with either FCL.1000(b) (special conditions for the introduction of a new type) or with (a) and (b) above (differences training on the new variant and instructor privileges).
				 
Pilots, instructors and examiners without existing type privileges shall complete the full type rating course and follow the requirements of Part-FCL for instructor and examiner privileges on any variant in the type.

                How can a national pilot licence be converted into an EASA pilot licence?            



 In accordance with Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 in the field of pilot licensing, the Agency is not authorised to issue pilot licences and therefore there will not be any EASA pilot licence in the future.
According to Annex I (Part-FCL) to Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 on Aircrew, the title of a new licence issued in accordance with this Annex is a Part-FCL licence.
National licences shall be converted into Part-FCL licences by the competent authority of the Member State that issued the national licence in accordance with Article 4 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 on Aircrew and its amending Commission Regulation (EU) No 290/2012.
Conclusion:

                How should the new class and type rating list for aeroplanes which is published on the Agency’s website be understood ? (complex aircraft, SET class, PA 46, instructor qualification)            



 The new list intends to make it easier to find specific aeroplanes by putting them into alphabetical order and abandoning the former grouping into many different lists. The aeroplanes which belong to the group of single pilot high performance complex aeroplanes are identified as such.
Information on the SET class:
		Those aeroplanes that belong to a specific group whilst they still require aeroplane specific training, testing and checking have a licence endorsement that specifies that they are in this group and the remarks column provides any information if an OSD report was established. (SET class with a validity of 2 years, FCL.740(a)).
		Nevertheless all members of the SET class rating group require a class rating specific for the aeroplane and those ratings have to be revalidated individually with the possibility of any credits that are mentioned in the OSD for the relevant aeroplane.
		There is no generic SET (land) or SET(sea) rating to be entered in a pilot licence.
		 
Information on PA 46:
		The piston engine variants of the PA 46 may now be treated as falling within the SEP(land) class but require a difference training on one of the PA 46 piston engine variants. For revalidation there is no class specific requirement the revalidation can be done by experience on any SEP plus a training flight on any SEP or any proficiency check or no experience and a proficiency check on any SEP.
		The SET PA 46 class rating can be obtained with an approved difference training course from the piston engine PA 46 or with a specific SET PA 46 class rating course both of which have to be done in an ATO on a SET PA 46. As it is a separate class rating the requirements of FCL.725 (a)(b)(c) apply and as it is an HPA also the relevant requirements for those aeroplanes apply.
		 
Information on instructor qualification for SET class:
		With the facts mentioned above the instructor requirements for a CRI or FI are to be considered class specific. Meaning PA 46 with piston engine will require an instructor qualification for SEP with difference training for the PA 46 piston engine. All SET class ratings to be covered as individual class ratings with individual instructor qualifications as indicated on the licence endorsement list.
The list will shortly undergo further editorial changes. The Agency tries to make the list more easily understandable and therefore has amended it and the explanatory note that comes with it.”

                When will the new rules on pilot licensing be applicable?            



 The new Implementing Rules implementing the requirements set out in Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 in the field of pilot licensing were published as Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 on Aircrew in the Official Journal of the European Union on 25 November 2011.
	In November 2011, the first four annexes to Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 on Aircrew were published:
Annex I - Part-FCL (flight crew licensing)
Annex II - Conditions for the conversion of existing national licences and ratings for aeroplanes and helicopters
Annex III - Conditions for the acceptance of licences issued by or on behalf of third countries
Annex IV - Part-MED (medical).
The remaining annexes were published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 5 April 2012 as Commission Regulation (EU) No 290/2012 amending Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 on Aircrew. These annexes are:
Annex V - Part-CC (cabin crew)
Annex VI - Part-ARA (authority requirements for aircrew)
Annex VII - Part-ORA (organisation requirements for aircrew)
As stated in Article 12 paragraph 1 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 on Aircrew, the application date was 8 April 2012, though by way of derogation from this paragraph in accordance with Article 1 paragraph (6) and Article 2 paragraph 2. (a) of Commission Regulation (EU) No 290/2012, Member States could decide not to apply the provisions of the aforementioned Annexes until 8 April 2013.
	The amending Regulation introduced additional transition measures deferring the applicability of certain Implementing Rules to a later date. Therefore the exact date of applicability of each requirement depends on the transition measures introduced by the Member States. 
	Until the date the new Implementing Rules apply, Member States national rules remain in force. 
	The related Acceptable Means of Compliance and Guidance Material to:
Part-FCL were published as Decision 2011/016/R of 15 December 2011;
Part-MED were published as Decision 2011/015/R of 15 December 2011;
Part-CC were published as Decision 2012/005/R of 19 April 2012;
Part-ARA were published as Decision 2012/006/R of 19 April 2012;
Part-ORA were published as Decision 2012/007/R of 19 April 2012.

                How can a third country (non-EU) licence be converted into a Part-FCL licence?            



 Pilots licences issued by third countries will be accepted in accordance with Article 8 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 on Aircrew .
According to paragraph 1 of this Article 8, the Member State may accept a third country licence, and the associated medical certificate, in accordance with the provisions of Annex III to the Regulation.
	For the issue of a Part-FCL licence, the holder of at least an equivalent third country licence issued in accordance with ICAO Annex 1 shall comply with all the relevant requirements of Annex I to the Regulation (Part-FCL), except that the requirements of course duration, number of lesson and specific training hours may be reduced.
As stated in Article 12 of Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 on Aircrew, the application date was 8 April 2012, though by way of derogation from this paragraph, Member States could decide not to apply the provisions of Annex I to pilots holding a licence and associated medical certificate issued by a third country involved in non-commercial flights until 8 April 2015.
The competent authority of the Member State to which an applicant applies will determine the conversion requirements, which can be reduced on the basis of a recommendation from an approved training organisation.
Therefore, the national aviation authority of the Member State where an applicant resides or wishes to work should be contacted for further information concerning the applicable acceptance requirements.
To find a list of the national aviation authorities, please follow this link.

                To whom can an appeal against the examination/test/check results be sent?            



 If an applicant does not agree with the result of his/her assessment, he/she can only resolve this problem at the national level.
An applicant cannot apply to the EASA management regarding a decision taken by his/her national aviation authority. Appeals to the Agency can only be made against decisions of the Agency.
Therefore the applicant should resolve this problem on the national level by sending his/her complaints to the national body dealing with complaints against state authorities.

                How can a military licence be converted to a civilian one?            



 The EU rules for recognising military licences can be found in Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 on Aircrew. Article 10 states that the knowledge, experience and skill gained in military service shall be credited towards the relevant requirements of Part-FCL in accordance with the principles of a credit report established by the competent authority of the Member State where a pilot served, in consultation with the Agency.
Therefore, the competent authority of the Member State where the pilot served should be contacted and asked for the provisions applicable for such credits.

                Can a co-pilot apply for a TRI rating on a multi pilot aeroplane (MPA)?            



 Yes, but the rating has to be restricted to simulator training only. The reason is that FCL.915 b) (3) stipulates that all instructors providing flight training in an aircraft have to be able to act as PIC during the training flight which would not be allowed to a co-pilot.

                To which extend flight synthetic training devices (FSTDs) can be used for UPRT?            



 Training and checking of UPRT exercises within the validated training envelope of the particular FSTD will be possible. In this context, it needs to be highlighted that the revised Part-FCL requirements will mandate the conduct of ‘approach-to-stall’ exercises only, with no obligation to conduct ‘post-stall’ exercises.

                Will UPRT also be mandatory for the LAPL and the PPL?            



 EASA Opinion No 06/2017 aims at integrating UPRT at various stages of a professional pilot’s career. The proposed new provisions of Part-FCL will therefore not be applicable to training courses for the light aircraft pilot licence (LAPL) and the private pilot licence (PPL).
However, in order to address the fact that loss of control in-flight is still a major issue in general aviation, EASA intends to revise the existing AMC/GM published with regard to the provisions of Part-FCL, with the objective to integrate basic UPRT elements into existing training syllabi for the LAPL and the PPL.

                What is UPRT?            



 UPRT stands for aeroplane ‘upset prevention and recovery training’ and constitutes a combination of theoretical knowledge and flying training with the aim of providing flight crew with the required competencies to both prevent and to recover from situations in which an aeroplane unintentionally exceeds the parameters for line operation or training (aeroplane upsets).
With the objective to introduce different ‘levels’ of UPRT at various stages of a professional pilot’s career, EASA has published its Opinion No 06/2017 and is currently revising the existing acceptable means of compliance (AMC) and guidance material (GM) published with regard to the provisions of Annex I (Part-FCL) to Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 as follows:
Basic UPRT will exercises to be integrated in all CPL and ATPL training courses as well as the MPL training course.
An ‘advanced UPRT course’ will include at least 5 hours of theoretical instruction as well as at least 3 hours of dual flight instruction in an aeroplane, with the aim to enhance the student’s resilience to the psychological and physiological aspects associated with upset conditions.
Class- or type-related UPRT during class or type rating training will address the specificities of the relevant class or type of aeroplane.

                    Flight Simulation Training Devices (FSTD)                  




        
            
                CS- FSTD(A) Issue 2 - UPRT Compliance of current qualified FSTD            



 In order to satisfy the FCL requirements, of Opinion 6, CS-FSTD(A) Issue 2 is applicable. For updated devices this can be done either through a special evaluation or at the recurrent evaluation (requires application for the Issue 2 elements to be evaluated and credited).
	Please refer to CS-FSTD(A) Issue 2 AMC11 FSTD(A).300 Guidance on high angle of attack/stall model evaluation, and approach to stall for previously qualified FSTDs.
	When considering the additional requirements under Issue 2 as well for the UPRT requirements please refer to the Explanatory Note to Decision 2018/006/R (reference section 2.5. What are the benefits and drawbacks “Safety improvement by further mitigating/preventing loss of control in-flight (LOC-I). Safety would improve due to the objective testing provisions which would validate not only the cruising configuration, but also the approach and landing configurations. Current FSTDs would be qualified to accurately reproduce the approach to stall in certain conditions and the behaviour of the aeroplane when affected by ice.”
	AMC11 applies to previously qualified devices and in some cases where the aeroplane being represented may not have the required validation data – this AMC allows an acceptable means of providing such test data by using a footprint method (when no validation data is available).
	If any of the elements of Issue 2 are missing, then this will be shown in the Qualification Certificate as “Restrictions or limitations” to show the users the capabilities of the FSTD.
	In conclusion, current qualified FSTD will not need to be fully compliant with CS-FSTD(A) issue 2 but only with the elements related to UPRT and icing. The qualification certificate of the FSTD will therefore show references to two PRDs (Primary Reference Document): 
The PRD used during the initial evaluation of the FSTD;
CS-FSTD(A) issue 2 for UPRT and icing.

                Where can I find definitions for ‘shall’, ‘must’, ‘should’ and ‘may’, as used in the Agency’s rulemaking publications?            



 This question relates to the English writing standards used in Community legislation. The following link gives access to the English Style Guide prepared by the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Translation. Guidance concerning the use of verbs in legislation can be found in paragraphs 10.19-10.27, as well as an explanation of the distinction between the verbs used in enacting or non-enacting terms. For more information click here . The Joint Practical Guide of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission also gives guidance on the principles of drafting Community legislation.

                What is the difference between European Community (EC) and European Union (EU) in the regulation reference?            



 The Lisbon Treaty, the latest primary treaty at EU level, was signed on 13 December 2007 and entered into force on 1 December 2009.
The European Union has been given a single legal personality under this Treaty.
Previously, the European Community and the European Union had different statutes and did not operate the same decision-making rules. The Lisbon Treaty ended this dual system.
On practical terms, all EU legislation has the reference to the EU since 1 December 2009. Up till then, the reference was made to the European Community (EC) as only this body had legal personality.

                What is the definition of an IR, AMC and CS and GM and what differences can be proposed?            



 Implementing Rules (IR) are binding in their entirety and used to specify a high and uniform level of safety and uniform conformity and compliance. The IRs are adopted by the European Commission in the form of Regulations.
Acceptable Means of Compliance (AMC) are non-binding. The AMC serves as a means by which the requirements contained in the Basic Regulation, and the IR, can be met. However, applicants may decide to show compliance with the requirements using other means. Both NAAs and organisations may propose alternative means of compliance. ‘Alternative Means of Compliance’ are those that propose an alternative to an existing AMC. Those Alternative Means of Compliance proposals must be accompanied by evidence of their ability to meet the intent of the IR. Use of an existing AMC gives the user the benefit of compliance with the IR.
Certification Specifications (CS) are non-binding technical standards adopted by the EASA to meet the essential requirements of the Basic Regulation. CSs are used to establish the certification basis (CB) as described below. Should an aerodrome operator not meet the recommendation of the CS, they may propose an Equivalent Level of Safety (ELOS) that demonstrates how they meet the intent of the CS. As part of an agreed CB, the CS become binding on an individual basis to the applicant.
Special Conditions (SC) are non-binding special detailed technical specifications determined by the NAA for an aerodrome if the certification specifications established by the EASA are not adequate or are inappropriate to ensure conformity of the aerodrome with the essential requirements of Annex Va to the Basic Regulation. Such inadequacy or inappropriateness may be due to:
the design features of the aerodrome; or
where experience in the operation of that or other aerodromes, having similar design features, has shown that safety may be compromised.
SCs, like CSs, become binding on an individual basis to the applicant as part of an agreed CB.
Guidance Material (GM) is non-binding explanatory and interpretation material on how to achieve the requirements contained in the Basic Regulation, the IRs, the AMCs and the CSs. It contains information, including examples, to assist the user in the interpretation and application of the Basic Regulation, its IRs, AMCs and the CSs.

                Implementing Rules are available in all of the national languages of the EASA Member States. How is the quality of these translations assured? Who is responsible for the translations?            



 EASA is committed to facilitating the production of good quality translations. To ensure this and, where necessary, to improve, EASA has set up a Translation Working Group in 2008. This Working Group is made up of members of the National Aviation Authorities (NAAs), the Translation Centre of the EU Bodies (CdT), as well as EASA staff members. Also, EASA in cooperation with NAAs and CdT, is developing glossaries in the different aviation domains, such as Air Operations or Air Traffic Management, to enhance the quality of translations. The Member States also contribute to this project in order to capitalise on existing material and experience.
The final responsibility for translations lies with the EU Commission. The correction of translation mistakes of the Implementing Rules follows the same formal procedure as for their adoption: 1. preparation of the proposal, 2. interservice consultation, 3. committee, 4. scrutiny of European Parliament and of European Council, and 5. adoption. For minor mistakes, the procedure may be shorter. In any case, the linguistic changes will have to be agreed by the Commission’s translation services. These linguistic services will check that no substantial change is introduced, that the term used is acceptable according to an internal translation code or that the same change is included in all linguistic versions.

                What is the progress of a regulation towards publication?            



 The Agency drafts regulatory material as Implementing Rules, Acceptable Means of Compliance, Guidance Material and Certification Specifications. These are available for consultation (as Terms of Reference, Notices of Proposed Amendment and Comment Response Documents). After consultation, the Implementing Rules are sent to the European Commission as Opinions.
Following publication of the Opinions, responsibility for completing the decision-making process prior to the Regulation’s publication in the Official Journal of the European Union passes onto the European Commission. The Opinions’ progress can be followed via the European Commission’s comitology website. It is advisable to search by year and for the committee dealing with these Opinions: Committee for the application of common safety rules in the field of civil aviation. As several Opinions may be negotiated in one such committee meeting, it is difficult to search by rule or title.
Once the committee has adopted the draft regulation, it is passed on to the European Parliament and Council for scrutiny. Further information and links to the documents under scrutiny can be found via the European Parliament’s Register of Documents.
The Agency is responsible for finalising the associated Acceptable Means of Compliance (AMC), Guidance Material (GM) and Certification Specifications. As these need to take into account any changes made to the Cover Regulation and Implementing Rules by the EASA Committee, European Parliament and Council, the Decisions are published on the Agency website shortly after the date when their corresponding regulation has been published in the Official Journal.
The Agency also publishes a rulemaking programme, listing the tasks that are ongoing and advance planning. It is available here.

                What is the legal status of documents published during the EASA Rulemaking process such as Notice of Proposed Amendment (NPA) or Comment Response Document (CRD)? Can they be used if there is no EU rule available?            



 NPAs and CRDs are part of the Agency's rulemaking process, to inform and consult stakeholders on possible rule changes or newly developed rules. The proposed rules are obviously not binding and still subject to change, either during the EASA rulemaking process or the Commission's comitology process. While an NPA and a CRD may give a broad indication on how the future rule could look like, EASA generally does not recommend using them before the rules are published in the Official Journal of the European Union.

                What is the comitology procedure?            



 Under the Treaty the European Commission is responsible for the required implementation of Community legislation in many areas. When exercising these delegated powers it is often obliged to work with national civil servants appointed by Member States in different committees. These committees, which are a forum for discussions and the voicing of opinions, are chaired by the European Commission.
For the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 (the Basic Regulation, BR) the European Commission is assisted by the EASA committee and the Single European Sky committee. Another committee of importance as regards aviation safety is the Air Safety committee, which is best known for being the guardian of the so called ‘Safety list’ as provided by Directive 2004/36/CE of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on the safety of third-country aircraft using Community airports.
The procedures which govern the work of these committees follow the standard procedures established in Regulation (EU) 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission’s exercise of implementing powers. It replaces Decision 1999/468/EC. This Regulation introduces a new ‘comitology’ procedure, which gives somewhat amended rights to Member States to control the way the Commission uses its delegated powers. The powers conferred to the European Parliament have been reduced slightly by the new Regulation and an Appeals Committee has been introduced in case no agreement can be reached in the committee. The latest comitology regulation can be consulted using the following link.
In principle the new comitology works as follows:
For the adoption of detailed implementing rules, the basic act may provide for the application of the examination procedure or the advisory procedure, taking into account the nature or the impact of the implementing act required.
The examination procedure applies, in particular, for the adoption of:
Implementing acts of general scope;
Other implementing acts relating to:programmes with substantial implications;
the common agricultural and common fisheries policies;
the environment, security and safety, or protection of the health or safety, of humans, animals or plants;
the common commercial policy;
taxation.

The advisory procedure applies, as a general rule, for the adoption of implementing acts not falling within the ambit of the aforementioned areas. However, the advisory procedure may apply for the adoption of the implementing acts referred to there in duly justified cases.
For the adoption of EASA implementing measures in the field of ATM/ANS and aerodromes only one procedure is relevant: the examination procedure.
However, to understand comitology in conjunction with the ATM and aerodromes regulatory processes it should be taken into account that the BR still refers to the old comitology process. In particular Articles 8a (Aerodromes) and 8c (Air Traffic Controllers) refer to Article 65(4) of the BR, which reads as follows:
Where reference is made to this paragraph, Article 5a (1) to (4), and Article 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.

Under the old regime this was dealt with by Single Sky and EASA committees using the Regulatory Procedure with Scrutiny.
Article 8b of the BR, however, refers to Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 549/2004, which reads as follows:
Where reference is made to this paragraph, Articles 5 and 7 of Decision 1999/468/EC shall apply, having regard to the provisions of Article 8 thereof.

This was dealt with by the Single Sky Committee under the Regulatory Procedure (without scrutiny).
	As said before, the new Regulation 182/2011 repeals the old comitology Decision, however, its Article 12 indicates that:
The effects of Article 5a of Decision 1999/468/EC shall be maintained for the purposes of existing basic acts making reference thereto.
So the regulatory procedure with scrutiny stays.
Article 13 indicates:
c. where the basic act makes reference to Article 5 of Decision 1999/468/EC, the examination procedure referred to in Article 5 of this Regulation shall apply ….

This means that the examination procedure replaces the old regulatory procedure. However, the examination procedure does not differ very much from the regulatory procedure. The whole procedure stays with the Single Sky committee and the EASA committee, even if no agreement is reached. It may in that case go to an appeal committee. In exceptional cases there may even be a consultation round by the Commission amongst the Member States. The Council is no longer involved. Parliament is involved only at a distance.
Conclusion:
Procedures applicable to aerodromes rules and ATCO licensing will hardly change. 
	Procedures applicable to ATM/ANS rulemaking will stay within the SSC, with possibility of appeals committee; there is no Council involvement; Parliament’s involvement only on distance.

                What does cover regulation mean?            



 Implementing rules are Commission regulations. A regulation is usually composed of a short introductory regulation, colloquially known as ‘cover regulation’, and Annexes thereto, containing the technical requirements for implementation. In the EASA system, these Annexes are usually called Parts (e.g. Part-21 is an annex to Regulation 1702/2003; Part-ORO is an annex to Regulation (EU) No 965/2012).
The ‘cover’ regulation is usually short (a few pages) and it includes:
The preamble made up of:
Citations (the paragraphs introduced by ‘Having regard to…’); and 
Recitals (clauses introduced by ‘whereas’), explaining the reasons for the contents of the enacting terms (i.e. the articles) of an act, the background principles and considerations that lead the legislator to adopt the regulation;

The articles of the regulation, which contain:
A description of the objective and scope of the regulation;
Definitions that are used throughout the regulation and its annexes;
The establishment of the applicability of its annex(es);
Conversion and transition measures.

                Can the information provided on EASA's FAQ be considered as legally binding?            



 EASA is not the competent authority to interpret EU Law. The responsibility to interpret EU Law rests with the judicial system, and ultimately with the European Court of Justice. EASA cannot even provide an 'authentic interpretation' (which is an official interpretation of a statute issued by the statute's legislator). Therefore any information included in these FAQs shall only be considered as EASA's understanding on a specific matter, and cannot be considered in any way as legally binding.

                    Continuing airworthiness - General                  




        
            
                What is the difference between Commission Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014 of 26 November 2014 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 2042/2003 as amended?            



 Commission Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014 of 26 November 2014 is an official consolidated version of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2042/2003 and its amendments published up to date, as follows:
(EC) No 707/2006;
(EC) No 376/2007;
(EC) No 1056/2008;
(EU) No 127/2010;
(EU) No 962/2010;
(EU) No 1149/2011; and
(EU) No 593/2012.
You can access the various lingual and format versions at: http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1421934905395&uri=CELEX:32014R1321 .
Commission Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014 (recast) repeals Regulation (EC) 2042/2003 and its amendments. Its date of application is 20 days after 17/12/2014 (date of publication in the Official Journal).
Some subsequent changes in that new Regulation compared to the old one(s) were deemed necessary but remain very minor, without any impact in its implementation. The following items can be mentioned:
The Cover Regulation, i.e. the recitals and articles at the beginning of the document have been adjusted;
Article 6(3) of Regulation (EU) 1321/2014 introduces new provisions related to the minimum syllabus of certifying staff type rating training in the operational suitability data for the relevant type in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 748/2012, which further refers to Part-66 Appendix III points 1 (a)(ii) and (b)(ii).
Some editorial corrections were introduced with no effect in its implementation.
Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014 contains references to Regulation (EC) 2042/2003 in the approval certificates (EASA Forms). These references will be changed with the next amending regulation planned before summer 2015.Until that moment the templates for the certificates and forms shall be used as published in Regulation (EU) 1321/2014
 
The existing approved AMCs/GMs covered by the EASA Decisions,  which complemented (EC) 2042/2003 as amended , keep on being valid for newly published Commission Regulation (EU) 1321/2014.

                As regard to the approval of the continuing airworthiness organisations, what is the sharing of responsibilities between EASA and the EASA Member States? How to get a list of the EASA approved continuing airworthiness organisations?            



 According to Article 20 of (EC) No.216/2008 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a EASA, the Agency is responsible for :
The management of all applications for organisations whose principal place of business is outside the territory of the EASA Member States (MS) for EASA Part-145 maintenance organisation approvals (MOA), EASA Part-147 maintenance training organisation approvals (MTOA), EASA Part-M Subpart G continuing airworthiness management organisation (CAMO) and EASA Part-M Subpart F approvals (Subpart F).
The oversight of related certificates and their continued surveillance.
These activities are as follows:
MOA: Part-145 organisations ('Foreign', USA and Canada ),
MTOA: Part-147 organisations,
CAMO: Part-M Subpart G organisations,
Subpart F : Part-M Subpart F organisations.
Such organisations, generally nicknamed as “foreign” organisations, are managed by EASA in accordance with the relevant Annexes of Regulation (EU) No.1321/2014 and the associated EASA procedures. For more information, see Continuing-airworthiness-organisations  where the lists of such  “foreign” organisations are available as well as the fees and charges Regulations.
The management of all applications for organisations whose principal place of business is inside the territory of the EASA Member States (MS) is performed by the competent authorities of these MS.
Therefore, information about continuing airworthiness management organisations, maintenance organisations and maintenance training organisation which have principal place of business within any of the EASA MS is kept up-to-date by  the competent authorities from these EASA MS. You may contact these authorities at http://easa.europa.eu/the-agency/member-states or consult their public websites when the MS accepted to publish these lists on a voluntary basis.

                Where can I find the continuing airworthiness requirements for third-country registered aircraft used by EU operator/owner?            



 The European Implementing Rules for continuing airworthiness (EU) 1321/2014 do apply to third-country registered aircraft if:
The regulatory safety oversight of such aircraft has been delegated to one of the Member States (*), in which case Part-M (Annex I) applies [see Article 3(1) of (EU) 1321/2014] or
The aircraft is dry leased-in by an EU licenced air carrier, in which case Part-T (Annex Va) is applicable [see Article 3(5) of (EU) 1321/2014].
When third-country registered aircraft are not captured by above-mentioned cases, it is advised to go back to the foundation of the EASA system, namely the Basic Regulation (BR), Regulation (EU) 2018/1139.
Reference should be made to Annex V (Essential requirements for air operations) in accordance with Article 29 for the aircraft described in Article 2(1)(b)(ii). Point 6 in Annex V of the BR describes air operations requirements related to continuing airworthiness, such as the requirement for release to service, pre-flight inspection, maintenance programme, records, … Being part of an Annex relevant to air operations, these requirements have to be overseen by the competent authority of the state of the operator.
Furthermore, as required by point 8 of Annex V of the BR, for commercial air transport and other operations subject to a certification or declaration requirement performed with aeroplanes, helicopters or tilt rotor aircraft, the continuing airworthiness management and maintenance tasks shall be controlled by an organisation, whose obligations (such as establishment of a management system) are referred to in points 8.8 and 8.9 of Annex V.
(*) – The transfer of a state’s oversight responsibility is addressed in Article 83bis bis of Chicago Convention.

                    Bilateral Agreement (BASA) - related to Continuing Airworthiness                  




        
            
                When do I need a dual release on FAA Form 8130-3 under EU/US bilateral agreement?            



 Under the terms of the EU/US bilateral agreement (BASA) (see here), a DUAL release is required for acceptance of USED engine/components from an US based repair station.
NOTE: a single EASA release on Form 8130-3 with only “Other regulation specified in block 12” ticked in block 14a is also acceptable for USED engine/components. This is to cover the case where component maintenance includes the installation of a used (sub)component released on an EASA Form 1 with ‘single release’ only, and therefore where the assembly is not eligible for US-registered aircraft.
CAUTION: DUAL release is not acceptable for ‘rebuilt’ engine/components because EASA recognises the term ‘rebuilt’ only as a manufacturing/production release (not a maintenance release) and only for engine.

                Can I import a rebuilt engine and associated components from US?            



 Under the terms of the EU/US bilateral agreement (BASA) (see here), you can import an engine with a ‘rebuilt’ status in block 11, only when it has been released by the original engine manufacturer on a Form 8130-3 using the blocks 13a. to 13e. (left side).
Please note that Form 8130-3 with ‘rebuilt’ status are not acceptable for components other than engine (regardless whether it has been released on left or right side) therefore the components accompanying the rebuilt engine should either be released REPAIRED/OVERHAULED… (right side) or NEW (left side).

                What kind of release document is considered equivalent to an EASA Form 1 under the terms of the US-EU Bilateral safety agreement? (AMC M.A.501(a)(5)(a)/AMC 145.A.42(a)(1)(a))            



 Under the terms of a EU/US bilateral agreement (BASA) (see here):
 
Acceptance of NEW engine/components (and rebuilt engines) is governed by the Technical Implementation Procedure (TIP). The general principle is to accept such engine/components when released new on FAA Form 8130-3 using the blocks 13a to 13e (left side). Please refer to Section VII (from para 7.7 on) of the TIP for the detailed conditions under which this is acceptable.
 
Acceptance of USED engine/components from an US based repair station is governed by the Maintenance Annex Guidance (MAG). The general principle is to accept such engine/components when subject to ‘dual release’ on FAA Form 8130-3 (except where the component is not eligible for U.S.-registered aircraft), using the blocks 14a to 14e (right side). 
Block 11 should provide the status of the component (e.g. ‘overhauled’) 
Block 12 should include (or refer to) detailed information on the work performed, the associated approved data (e.g. ‘Overhauled in accordance with CMM 111, Section X, Rev 2, S/B 23 and FAA AD xyz complied with’) as well as the EASA Part-145 statement and approval number.
Block 14 should at least show “Other regulation specified in block 12” ticked
Please refer to Appendix 1 of section B, paragraph 10 (Release and acceptance of components) of the MAG for the detailed conditions under which this is acceptable.

                Can an independent certifying staff maintain ELA1 aircraft used for commercial operations (such as ATO)?            



 No, ELA1 aircraft used for commercial operations cannot be maintained by independent certifying staff because in accordance with M.A.201(i) commercial operations require maintenance release by an organisation (part-M subpart-F or part-145 approved).

                Which are the correct statements to be written in block 11 of EASA Form 1 after maintenance?            



 Appendix II to part-M describes the following 4 permissible entries in block 11 of EASA Form 1:
Overhauled,
Repaired
Inspected/tested
Modified
The meaning of “Inspected/Tested” status is inspected and/or, if applicable, tested as it described in provisions of part-M/part-145.  Besides that, block 12 in the EASA Form 1 should contain the detailed information on the status/work described in block 11.

                Can a licenced pilot without a valid medical certificate perform pilot-owner maintenance?             



 This question arises because of the different understandings of license validity in Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 (Aircrew) and No 1321/2014 (Continuing Airworthiness).
In Reg. (EU) 1321/2014, the pilot-owner authorisation described in M.A.803 assumes that a pilot has sufficient technical knowledge to perform certain maintenance tasks. While exercising such pilot-owner authorisation, the pilot-owner even further develops his/her competency in maintenance. Hence, in the case where the medical examination has not been conducted or not been passed and the licence has therefore lost its validity, it is the intent of the rule to allow the pilot-owner to continue using this authorisation as long as he/she still considers himself/herself physically fit (including good visual acuity) and competent to carry out such maintenance (ref. point (a)(2) of Appendix VIII to Part-M).
This is the reason why a new point (5) was introduced in AMC M.A.803 in 2016 (ED Decision 2016/011/R) stating: “not holding a valid medical examination does not invalidate the pilot licence (or equivalent) required for the purpose of the pilot-owner authorisation”.

                What are the responsibilities relevant to pre-flight inspection?            



 The pre-flight inspection forms part of the essential requirements for air operation, as required in Annex V (point 6.2) of the ‘Basic Regulation’ (Regulation (EU) 2018/1139). Being relevant to the aircraft’s fitness for the intended flight, this essential requirement is implemented by the Commission Regulation (EU) 1321/2014 for continuing airworthiness in the following way:

Reference


Obligation


Who


Remark


M.A.201(d)


Carry out pre-flight inspection satisfactorily


Pilot-in-command or, in case of Licensed Air Carrier, a qualified staff under the responsibility of the operator (e.g. maintenance staff - see note)


 


M.A.301(1)


Ensure pre-flight inspection is carried out


Owner or CAMO (according to M.A.201)


 


Ensure pre-flight inspection includes the actions necessary to ensure that the aircraft is fit to carry out the intended flight


AMC M.A.301(1) point(1) and (2) elaborates those actions


If a/c managed by CAMO: Provide training to ensure that pre-flight inspection is carried out adequately [AMC M.A.301(1) point (3)]


CAMO


Pre-flight inspection training described in the CAME in part 1.11 [‘Appendix V to AMC M.A.704’]


Additional information:


 
M.A.712(b)


If a/c managed by CAMO:
					Ensure pre-flight inspection is subject to the quality system
					[AMC M.A.301(1) point (3)]


CAMO

This is important because the pre-flight inspection contributes in feeding the process of aircraft continuing airworthiness
 
Note:
	As per the definition of ‘maintenance’ in article 2 point(h) of Commission Regulation (EU) 1321/2014, ‘pre-flight inspection’ (as defined in article 2(j)) is not considered maintenance. Therefore it does not require a certificate of release to service [M.A.201(d)].

                What are the plans of EASA concerning the Continuing Airworthiness of aircraft operated under the new Part-DTO (Annex VIII to Reg. (EU) No 1178/2011 as amended)?            



 Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 was amended in July 2018 to introduce Part-DTO as regards to declared training organisations (ref. Reg. (EU) 2018/1119). This amendment of Aircrew Regulation requires also an amendment of Part-M, which has not been adopted to date but will be reflected in the next amendment of Reg. (EU) 1321/2014.
	The intent is to specify that commercial training organisations, whether ATO or DTO, will have the same Continuing Airworthiness obligations.
This amendment of Part-M will, in particular, clarify the following:
 
Complex motor-powered aircraft                                            
Other than complex motor-powered aircraft                                              

Commercial DTO             

M.A.201(f) applicable
				CAMO required
M.A.201(h) applicable
				CAMO* is required
Non-commercial DTO                
M.A.201(g) applicable
				CAMO required
M.A.201(i) applicable
				CAMO* not required

NOTE: With adoption of Part-ML (Opinion 05/2016), CAMO* will not be required for organisations that operate Part-ML aircraft under Part-NCO. That means any DTO organisation operating Part-ML aircraft under Part-NCO will not be required to contract (or be approved as) a CAMO*.
* or CAO organisation with continuing airworthiness management privilege, once Opinion 05/2016 is adopted

                Can an airworthiness review certificate (ARC)/recommendation be issued after an airworthiness review with open findings?            



 Neither an ARC nor a recommendation can be issued with open findings. Each finding requires a corrective action before the issue of the ARC or recommendation. The corrective action should be adequate to the open finding and it should be carried out and verified by the airworthiness review staff (ARS) before the issue of the ARC/ recommendation.

                Can an extension of an ARC be anticipated more than 30 days?            



 As long as the conditions established for controlled environment (M.A.901 (b): continuously managed during the previous 12 months by a unique CAMO and maintained for the previous 12 months by part-145/part-M subpart F maintenance organisations or maintenance tasks referred to in point M.A.803(b) carried out and released to service by independent certifying staff (M.A.801(b)2) or pilot owner (M.A.801(b)3)  are met, the validity of the ARC can be extended for a period of one year. Should the ARC extension be anticipated more than 30 days, you will lose the continuity of the airworthiness review pattern, being the next date of expiry one year after the date of extension.

                Can an Airworthiness Review Staff (ARS) perform an airworthiness review on an aircraft in which he/ she had released some maintenance as Certifying Staff (CS)?            



 To avoid possible conflict of interests, the ARS (Airworthiness Review Staff) should not be or have been involved in the release of the maintenance for the aircraft on which he or she intends to perform the airworthiness review (AR), except in one of the following cases:
Such maintenance has been released as part of the airworthiness review’s physical survey of the aircraft (e.g. release necessary after visual inspections requiring panel opening).
Such maintenance has been released as a result of findings discovered during the physical survey of the aircraft (defect rectification)Note: cases 1 and 2 are justified by the fact that such specific maintenance activity is part of the AR and therefore does not require independence between maintenance and the AR.
Such maintenance has been released as part of the annual inspection contained in the maintenance programme conducted together with the Airworthiness Review (for ELA1 aircraft not involved in commercial operations). Refer to M.A.901(l).
From regulatory perspective, cases 1 and 2 are explicitly considered by AMC M.A.707(a) [2nd bullet of point (5)] for an ARS belonging to a CAMO also holding a AMO approval. Although not explicitly mentioned in any AMC, considering the note above, the Agency understands that this principle is also permitted in other cases where the ARS is also Certifying staff. Such cases include for example standalone ARS as per M.A.901(g) or ARS personnel of an AMO with 145.A.75(f) or M.A.615(e) privilege.
Remark: iaw AMC M.A.710(b) and (c) points 1 and 2, when the ARS is not Certifying Staff, he/she must be assisted by a Certifying Staff to release the maintenance mentioned in cases 1 and 2.

                Can the airworthiness review certificate (ARC) of the large aircraft be extended during the extensive maintenance/long term storage?            



 An ARC extension could be performed as long as:
the conditions established for controlled environment (M.A.901 (b)) are met. This means:continuously managed during the previous 12 months by a unique CAMO, and
maintained for the previous 12 months by Part 145 organisations.

AND
there is no evidence or reason to believe that the aircraft is not airworthy, as stated in M.A.901(k).
Thus, the procedure for the extension established in the CAMO has to address verification of the compliance with 3 above mentioned conditions. An aircraft going through the lengthy maintenance/modification or long-term storage is not considered to meet the condition number 2.

                CAMO 1 uses the anticipation when performing  the airworthiness review or extension for 90 or 30 days correspondingly. After the issue or extension of the ARC, the aircraft is transferred during the anticipation period from CAMO 1 to CAMO 2. As the consequence CAMO 2 has solely continuously managed the aircraft for more than 12 months due to the term of the validity of the ARC accordingly being more than 12 month. Are the requirements of the M.A.901(b)(i) satisfied?            



 The intent of the article M.A.901(b)(i) is to define the ‘controlled environment’ by indicating that the aircraft must be managed during last 12 months by unique CAMO, which indirectly refers to a standard term of validity of the ARC.  Therefore, if the aircraft has been managed by more than one CAMO since the date of issue of the last ARC or the date of issue of the ARC extension, it actually indicates that controlled environment was discontinued.
In addition in accordance with M.A.710(d) the 90 days anticipation shall be used to allow the physical review to be performed during a maintenance check. However, the intention of the rule was never to address the transfer of the aircraft within those 90 days with the purpose of avoiding the forthcoming airworthiness review.  Concerning the 30 days anticipation for the ARC extension, point M.A.901(f) is intended for 2 consecutive extensions by the same CAMO managing the continuing airworthiness of the aircraft from the date of issue of the ARC, so the extended ARC could not be extended 2nd time by another organisation, because this constitutes a ‘breach’ of controlled environment.

                Is EASA Forms 1 required during the import of the aircraft in the EU?            



 For the import of aircraft in the EU, the provisions of M.A.904 require the accomplishment of the airworthiness review, associated AMC M.A.904(a)(2) defines work to be performed in order to determine the airworthiness status of the aircraft.
When performing the airworthiness review there would be certain provisions of part-M where it might be not possible to show the full compliance with M.A.710 e.g. availability of EASA Form 1 for all relevant components. In such case, other releases to service or serviceable tags may be acceptable for the competent authority of the importing country.
Nevertheless, it must be ensured that the information required by M.A.305(d) related to the status of ADs, determination of remaining life, modifications and repairs is available (see also AMC M.A.305(d)).

                    Technical records                  




        
            
                Is there any European requirement to maintain the back-to-birth traceability for any component fitted to an European aircraft?            



 The term “back to birth” is not used in European regulations. The requirements that apply to a service life-limited component (see definition in AMC M.A.305) are basically stated in M.A.305 (e) and (h). All detailed maintenance records of a maintenance action (e.g. a restoration) must be kept until another maintenance action equivalent in scope (another restoration) is done, but never less than 36 months. Keep in mind that:
a service life limited component log card must be kept with all the relevant information, so the action should be recorded there, and
the records showing compliance with other requirements stated in M.A.305, e.g. an airworthiness directive, or any other information that could be affecting the configuration of the aircraft, must be retained too.

                What does the term “detailed maintenance records” mean?            



 There has been a certain confusion about the understanding of “detailed maintenance records”, because this term is used in a different context for continuing airworthiness management and approved maintenance organisation (AMO).  
“Detailed maintenance records” as defined in M.A.614 or 145.A.55(c) are required to be kept by an AMO (respectively Part-M/F organisation or Part-145 organisation). Maintenance organisations are required to retain all detailed records in order to be able to demonstrate that they maintained aircraft and components in compliance with applicable requirements (see also remark).
“Detailed maintenance records” as defined in M.A.305(h)(1) are those records, coming from the AMO1  having performed maintenance, required to be kept by the owner/operator (or the CAMO when required by M.A.201) allowing to determine the aircraft configuration, the airworthiness status of the aircraft and all components installed, as well as to plan future maintenance as required by the AMP, based on the last accomplishment.
	Consequently, the AMO should transmit to the owner/operator/CAMO a certain subset of the AMO maintenance records, including the certificates of release to service and repair/modification data related to the performed maintenance, so that the owner/operator/CAMO can demonstrate compliance with M.A.305.  
	Not all AMO maintenance records need to be transferred from the AMO to the owner/operator unless they specifically contain information relevant to aircraft configuration/ status and future maintenance. Thus, incoming certificates of conformity, batch number references and individual task card sign-offs verified by and/or generated by the maintenance organisation are not required to be transferred to the owner/operator/CAMO. However, dimensional information contained in the task card sign-offs or work packages may need to be transferred and kept by the owner/ operator.
It is to be noted that the record-retention period requirements are slightly different for the AMO and the CAMO. The AMO shall retain the records for 3 years, whereas the CAMO has to retain their records until they are superseded by new information (equivalent in scope and detail), but not less than 3 years. The starting point in both cases is when the aircraft or component maintenance has been released.
Remark: It is considered a best practice as part of the AMO record-keeping system, (and it is also required by certain competent authorities) to record information (e.g. batch number or other tracking reference) relevant to the identification of all standard parts and material used during any maintenance. This practice may limit safety and industrial risks in the case where a batch is recalled by the manufacturer. Such record does not need to be transmitted to the owner/operator/CAMO.

*: Transmitted records is a subset of AMO maintenance records provided to the CAMO. Certain transmitted records do not need to be kept as a record by the CAMO such as EASA Form 1 for a component with no scheduled maintenance task selected and not subject to AD or modification/repair.**: by new information equivalent in scope and detail
1 Or pilot-owner [M.A.803], or independent certifying staff [M.A.801(b)(2)]

                Must the EASA Form 1 be kept for on-condition components ?            



 There is no specific requirement to retain the EASA Form 1 of such components unless needed to comply with the requirements set forth in M.A.305 (h)(1), (h)(4), (h)(5) and (h)(6) for determining the continuing airworthiness and configuration of the aircraft.

                    AMP (Aircraft Maintenance Programme)                  




        
            
                What are the alleviations introduced by M.A.302(h) on the maintenance programme for General Aviation?            



 In accordance with M.A.302(h), for ELA1 aircraft not involved in commercial operation, the owner, whether he has contracted a CAMO or not [see M.A.201(i)], has the option not to submit the Aircraft Maintenance Programme (AMP) to the competent authority for approval, but instead ‘declare’ an AMP, subject to compliance with the conditions described therein. In this respect, the owner may decide to deviate from the applicable scheduled maintenance recommendations (see also remark below) without the need to justify such deviation(s), but under his/her full responsibility. Such declared AMP does not need to be sent to the competent authority.
In this scenario though, the declared AMP shall not be less restrictive than the ‘Minimum Inspection Programme’ (MIP) referred to in point M.A.302(i). 
	A clear overview of the different options for the development (including the source of information and potential customisation) and approval of such an AMP is provided by ‘GM M.A.201(i), M.A.302(h) and M.A.901(l)’.
In addition, such declared AMP shall be reviewed annually and this review can be done either by the person who performs the airworthiness review, during the accomplishment of the airworthiness review, or by a CAMO if contracted to manage the continuing airworthiness of the aircraft [see M.A.302(h)5]. 
Besides, if during the airworthiness review it is observed that there are discrepancies on the aircraft linked to deficiencies in the content of the maintenance programme, the competent authority shall be informed and the AMP amended.
Remarks: 
In accordance with M.A.302 and in particular M.A.302(h)(3), the AMP, declared or approved, shall in all cases include all the mandatory maintenance/continuing airworthiness requirements, such as repetitive Airworthiness Directives or the Airworthiness Limitation Section (ALS).
In accordance with Part-M Appendix VIII point (b)(9), the tasks that are part of the annual or 100h check contained in the ‘Minimum Inspection Programme’ do not qualify for pilot-owner maintenance referred to in M.A.803.
References:
	Please refer also to AMC M.A.302(e) (maintenance programme template), AMC M.A.302(h), GM M.A.302(h) and AMC M.A.302(i) (content of MIP).
Please refer to Article 2 (point k) of Regulation (EU) 1321/2014 for the definition of ELA1.
Please refer to Article 3 (point i) of Regulation (EU) 216/2008 for the definition of commercial operation.
	The agency also advises the owner who intends to transition from conventional to declared AMP to contact the competent authority for their guidance.

                When does the interval for the next calendar aircraft maintenance check/task or the calendar interval for the next component check/overhaul starts?            



 In a normal scenario :
The date of signing the certificate of release to service (CRS) should be considered the date of the accomplishment.
The next due date should be calculated using this date.
However, there may be a lot of different considerations that change the normal scenario and make the statements above no longer valid. For example:
Case 1: The interval of the maintenance task has been ‘extended’ using a procedure included in the aircraft maintenance programme and approved by competent authority (refer to Appendix I to AMC M.A.302 point 4). Such procedure is often referred as permitted variation or ’tolerance’. In this case the next due date calculated using the original due date.
Case 2: The maintenance task refers to a component maintenance task, for example the landing gear overhaul. In this case the start of the interval would be the date of the release to service after the overhaul of the landing gear or in some particular cases when specified in the maintenance data the interval may start from the date of installation.
Case 3: The task is part of a maintenance check, where the duration of the check is significant compared to the interval of the task. For example, a check that lasts for 2 months and an inspection that has an interval of 3 months. In this case, it is reasonable to think that the performance of this task would need to be planned for the last days of the maintenance check, when possible. Otherwise, the inspection also can be done on the first day, but in that case, it is reasonable to expect that it will be released the same day (then the next due date would be 3 months after the CRS is signed). It also applies to the specific cases of mandatory tasks (ADs, CMRs, ALIs, etc.) defining repetitive action with a calendar limit.
There are many other examples, the key is to use sound engineering judgment and the guidance provided in the Instructions for Continuing Airworthiness to calculate the next due date.

                When should I revise my Aircraft Maintenance Programme (AMP)?            



 In accordance with M.A.302(g), the Aircraft Maintenance Programme (AMP) shall be subject to ‘periodic reviews’ and amended accordingly when necessary. 
This means that the owner/operator/CAMO should review at a regular interval:
new/modified maintenance instructions by the TC holder, 
modifications and repairs embodied in the particular a/c, which may require compliance to additional maintenance instructions (by Design Approval Holder),
in-service experience collected for the particular a/c or for the fleet and
changes in the type and specificity of operations
Such a review allows to determine if an AMP revision is necessary to still comply with the obligations of M.A.302(d)(ii)/(iii) and ensure that the AMP continues to be valid in light of the operating experience. As a minimum, point (3) of AMC M.A.302 states it should be at least a 1-year review interval (annual review). 
However, this should not prevent amending the AMP outside of this formal periodic review, when a specific need arises. This may depend for example on in-service experience (e.g. adverse trend), nature of instruction revisions (e.g. significant reduction of TBO (time between overhaul)), the extent of instruction revisions (amount of affected tasks) as well as source of instruction revisions (e.g. MRBR, ALS, etc.)    
When a revision of the ALS (Airworthiness Limitation Section) introduces a new or more restrictive task, EASA has the policy to issue an AD (Airworthiness Directive). Such an AD would typically mandate on one side the revised task accomplishment and on the other side the revision of the AMP itself, together with a compliance time for these two actions.
	However, in accordance with point (3) of AMC M.A.302, EASA recommends to review the AMP as soon as possible in this case to avoid a disconnection between accomplished maintenance task(s) and maintenance task(s) listed in the AMP.
If the aircraft’s continuing airworthiness is being managed by a CAMO, the CAME (Continuing Airworthiness Management Exposition) should describe the AMP revision policy (including ‘periodic review’) under point 1.2 [Appendix V to AMC M.A.704].

	Remark: In the case where the source documents are amended without having an effect on the AMP content, it is acceptable to use an indirect approval procedure (if granted by the competent authority in accordance with M.A.302(c)) to amend the relevant source document references in the AMP.

                Can a competent authority require the owner/ CAMO to include national requirements in the Aircraft Maintenance Programme (AMP), based on M.A.302(d)(i)?            



 Although the Member State’s competent authorities are responsible for approving the AMP, the intention of the rule is that they should not impose aeronautical instructions (such as national requirements) in addition to the instructions for continuing airworthiness (ICA) issued by the design approval holder during the certification process with the Agency. The Agency is, on behalf of the Member States, the competent authority for initial airworthiness as per Article 77(1) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 (the EASA ‘Basic Regulation’). Following M.A.302(d)(ii), those ICA shall be the basis to develop an AMP.
Nevertheless, competent authorities may issue alternate instructions to ICA when such instructions aim to offer flexibility to the operator [AMC M.A.302(d) point (2)].
Additionally, the mentioned AMC facilitates the rare case, where there have been no ICA issued by the design approval holder for a particular aircraft, modification, repair or STC (Supplemental Type Certificate): competent authorities may issue relevant instructions for the AMP in this case.
Remarks:
The airworthiness (initial and continuing) of the aircraft referred to in Annex I to the Basic Regulation has to comply with the national rules of the state of registry, which may include ‘national requirements’.
If the AMP is self-declared, based on the M.A.302(h) alleviation for ELA1 aircraft not involved in commercial operation, it cannot be initially challenged by the competent authority and the owner assumes full responsibility for its content (including potential deviations to ICA - see FAQ n.43423).
There is no equivalent of US CFR Title 14 Part-43 Appendix E/Part-91 (§91.411) or Part-43 Appendix F/Part-91 (§91.413) in the EU system.

                How is it possible to escalate AMP task intervals?            



 General:
	Some general expectations for escalation initiatives are described in the following paragraph:
	a) It should be ensured that the AMP continues to be valid in light of the operating experience [M.A.302(g) – see FAQ n.47406].
	b) It should form part of the analysis of the effectiveness of the AMP (if required by M.A.301(4)),
	c) The AMP should include a procedure to manage the escalation of established intervals [AMC M.A.302 point (4) and point (2) of AMC M.B.301(c)].
	    Supported by
	      - formal reliability programme if required by M.A.302(f) or voluntarily implemented [AMC M.A.302(d) point (6)] or
	      - collection and analysis of in-service experience.
	 ‘Appendix I to AMC M.A.302 and AMC M.B.301(b)’ provides detailed guidelines for the integration of this information into the AMP.
	d) If there is a CAMO involved, those points also have to be emphasised within the CAME, as specified in Appendix V to AMC M.A.704.
Two different cases:
	The escalation of AMP task intervals falls into the alternative instructions proposed by the owner/ CAMO [M.A.302(d) point (iii)] and distinguishes in the following cases:
	Case 1:
	Escalation of safety-related task intervals, which consist of all mandatory tasks (Airworthiness Limitation Section) as well as certain non-mandatory tasks issued by the DAH (Design Approval Holder) such as various MRBR (Maintenance Review Board Report) tasks [see note below], tasks related to emergency equipment, critical components…
	Case 2:
	Escalation of non-safety-related task (e.g. non-safety related MRBR task or a task recommended by a Service Letter) intervals
Note:
	In cases, where the aircraft type has been subjected to the MRB process, the following MRBR tasks should be considered safety-related:
	- Failure Effect Category (FEC) ‘5’ (evident safety) and ‘8’ (hidden safety) tasks (systems and powerplant)
	- SSI (Structural Significant Item) tasks
	- L/HIRF (Lightning / High Intensity Radiated Field) tasks (as applicable)
	- Stand-alone EWIS tasks (EZAP procedure)
Escalation approval:
	The approval of a task escalations is addressed separately for each case:
Regarding case 1:
	1.1 Escalation of mandatory tasks represents a change of the initial type design and therefore must be discussed and agreed between the DAH and the Agency*.
	1.2 The AMP revision proposal and the information used to substantiate the escalation of non-mandatory tasks [AMC M.B.301(d)] have to be evaluated by the competent authority [AMC M.B.301(b) point (2)]. Following a positive evaluation, a direct approval of the AMP revision will be issued by the competent authority, as stated in M.A.302(d) point (iii).
Regarding case 2:
	An indirect approval of the AMP through a CAMO is possible and described in more detail in FAQ n.19061.
* Exception may exist under certain condition for Two Star CMR (Certification Maintenance Requirement) (see AMC 25-19).
	 
Remarks:
	- In all cases, task de-escalation may need to be considered based on the supporting data [AMC M.A.302(f) point (4)].
	- Escalation should not be confused with ‘permitted variations’ to AMP intervals, which applies to a unique aircraft for a unique occasion [‘Appendix I to AMC M.A.302 and AMC M.B.301(b)’ point (4)].

                What kind of alternative (other than escalation) or additional instructions can be introduced in the AMP?            



 For guidance on the escalation of AMP task intervals, please refer to FAQ no.48248.
Examples of alternative/ additional instructions to the Design Approval Holder’s (DAH) Instructions for Continuing Airworthiness (ICA) are listed below [see point (7) of AMC M.A.302(d)]:
1. De-escalation of task intervals (i.e. ‘more restrictive intervals’). Regardless of the source of the task, this may be eligible to indirect approval [see FAQ n.19061].
2. Additional scheduled maintenance tasks selected by the operator on voluntary basis (e.g. operator policy for interiors), or manufacturer recommendations outside ICA (e.g. Service Letter) linked to product improvements or maintenance practices... Depending on their nature, those tasks may be added, changed and deleted through the indirect approval [see FAQ n.19061].
Remark: Additional and de-escalated tasks may originate from the reliability programme as indicated in point (4) of AMC M.A.302(f).
3. Concerning changes in task type (e.g. from General Visual Inspection to Detailed Inspection, or from Operational Check to Functional Check), by analogy with the escalation [see FAQ no.48248] EASA recommends that for safety-related tasks such changes are directly approved by the competent authority. For non-safety related tasks, the competent authority may accept an indirect approval.
Finally, please be aware of the alleviations applicable for AMPs of ELA1 aircraft not involved in commercial operation, which are elaborated in FAQ n.43423.

                Are deputy nominated persons required in CAMO?            



 Neither M.A.706 (c) nor M.A.706 (d)  contain a specific requirement for the identification of deputy “nominated persons” as in part-145 (145.A.30(b)(4)). So, in principle, we could say that there is no requirement for the nomination or identification of deputy “nominated persons”.
Nevertheless, the CAMO needs to take into account the conditions for the continued validity of the approval contained in M.A.715, in particular point (a)(1) which refers to the continued validity of the approval provided the organisation remains in compliance with the requirements.
The CAMO should ensure that they remain in compliance during the absence of the nominated persons, this could be by identifying in the CAME  “one or several deputies” and the conditions under which the deputies will assume the responsibilities (this option could be acceptable for a short/medium absence). Another option would be to nominate another person. This would be necessary when the absence is going to be of considerable length and in this case the nomination and acceptance by the competent authority is done using the Form 4.

                Under which condition can a CAMO use the indirect approval procedure to amend AMP (Aircraft Maintenance Programme) task?            



 The indirect approval procedures may only be used for:
- non-safety-related tasks as described in case 2 of FAQ n.48248 and example 3 of FAQ n.48249
- de-escalated tasks as described in example 1 of FAQ n.48249
- additional tasks as described in example 2 of FAQ n.48249
- editorial issues, typos, etc., (without having an effect on the AMP content)
In such case, as required by M.A.302(c) and M.B.301(c), the CAME (Continuing Airworthiness Management Exposition) must include, and the competent authority shall approve, a procedure describing as a minimum:
	- Which AMP amendments are eligible for indirect approval
	- Who in the CAMO is responsible to issue of the indirect approval
	- How the amendments are controlled
	- How and when the competent authority is informed of an amendment
Based on M.A.302(c), the indirect approval may only be used when:
	- The aircraft is managed by a CAMO or there is a limited contract between the owner and the CAMO for the development and approval of the AMP;   and
	- The aircraft managed by the CAMO is registered in the Member State ensuring the oversight of this CAMO (unless an agreement exists between the competent authority for the AMP and the competent authority of the CAMO).

                Do the maintenance contracts need to be submitted for the approval to the competent authorities after Commission Regulation (EU) 2015/1536 applies?            



 M.A.708(c) requires the CAMO to establish a written maintenance contract for CMPA or aircraft used for CAT or commercial specialised operations or commercial ATO operations.
The individual contracts need not to be submitted for approval to the competent authority. The competent authority shall approve the procedures for contracted maintenance as part of the CAME Part 3 and the basic information of the contracted maintenance should be included in a list of contracted maintenance organisations in the CAME part 5.4.
The amendment to the list mentioned in 5.4 may be managed through the indirect approval procedure.
Only for air carriers licenced in accordance with Regulation (EC) 1008/2008, the maintenance contracts need to be submitted to the competent authority as part of the package for initial application or for a change to the Air Operator Certificate as indicated in under M.B.701(a)(4).

                Does the CAMO quality system need to be subject to monitoring?             



 Yes, the quality system is part of the activities of the CAMO and therefore it should be monitored.
Point M.A.712(b) requires that the quality system monitors:
that all CAMO activities are being performed in accordance with the approved procedures, and,
the continued compliance with requirement of part-M.
The quality system procedures are considered to be within these approved procedures . This implies that quality system must be subject to audits and the CAMO audit programme/plan needs to reflect this.
Besides that the audits to the quality system shall satisfy the requirement of independent audits. This is further explained in AMC M.A.712(b) point 8: the independence of the audits should be established by always ensuring that audits are carried out by personnel not responsible for the functions, procedures or products being checked. So, the quality manager cannot audit the quality system in terms of independence of the audit. Therefore, to audit the quality system, it is acceptable:
to use competent personnel from a different section/department in the same organisation not responsible for the quality function/procedure, or,
to contract the independent audit element of the quality system to another organisation or a qualified competent person, or,
that the quality system is monitored and certified against an internationally recognised quality standards by a certification organisation
The way the quality system is going to be audited has to be described in the CAME and approved by the competent authority.

                Is Part-M applicable to approved Part-145 organisations?            



 Yes, Part-M is applicable to Part-145 organisations. Article 3(2) of Regulation (EU) 1321/2014 states that organisations and personnel involved in maintenance of aircraft and components shall comply with Part-M. Nevertheless, not all the requirements of Part-M are relevant to Part-145 organisations.
In addition to the Part-M provisions directly referred to in Part-145 (such as reference to M.A.304 in 145.A.48 or to EASA Form 1 in Appendix I to Part-145), the following Part-M requirements shall also be considered by Part 145 organisations:
M.A.201(c) – Responsibilities
M.A.403(b) – Aircraft defects

                What does the term ‘occasional’ mean in 145.A.75(c)?            



 Within the privilege described in 145.A.75(c) an aircraft maintenance organisation (AMO) may perform line maintenance activity in other-than-approved locations, provided it is considered as ‘occasional’. There is no formal definition of ‘occasional’ in the regulation, AMC and GM, but this privilege should be used to support an operator with which the AMO is already in contractual relation, when this operator needs line maintenance service for a short period at a new location due to a special occasion or particular reason (e.g. one-time flights, short term contracts/flight destination, flight schedule changes, special event at a particular location such as European athletics championship in Berlin, 6-12 August 2018, etc.).
Subject to the approval by the Competent Authority, the maintenance organisation should develop in the MOE (e.g. Chapter 2.24 Reference to Specific Maintenance Procedures) the generic procedures to be followed in such a case: how to assess whether the maintenance can be performed, availability of tools/ equipment/ material/ components/ maintenance data, staff, adequacy of the facilities, environmental conditions, quality system, record keeping, need to report these cases to the competent authority, etc. In addition, the procedure should include the criteria (e.g. maximum service duration without gap in the continuity; limitation in the repetition of the need* at one given location) to classify the activity as ‘occasional line maintenance’.
* In principle, the repetitive use of this privilege at the same location should not be considered, and for repetitive needs, an approved line station should normally be established at that location.

                Does the part-145 quality system need to be subject to monitoring?             



 Yes, the quality system is part of the activities of the part-145 organisation and therefore it should be monitored.
Point 145.A.65 (c) requires that the quality system monitors that the activities are being performed in accordance with the approved procedures. The quality system procedures are included within these approved procedures. This implies that quality system must be subject to audits and the part-145 organisation audit programme/plan needs to reflect this.
Besides that the audits of the quality system shall satisfy the requirement of independent audits. This is further explained in AMC 145.A.65(c)(1) point 11: the independence of the audits should be established by always ensuring that audits are carried out by personnel not responsible for the functions, procedures or products being checked. So, the quality manager cannot audit the quality system in terms of independence of the audit.
	Therefore, to audit the quality system, it is acceptable to:
use competent personnel from a different section/department in the same organisation not responsible for the quality function/procedure, or,
contract the independent audit element of the quality system to another organisation or a qualified competent person.
The way the quality system is going to be audited has to be described in the MOE and approved by the competent authority.

                    Certification of maintenance                  




        
            
                With respect to blend out repairs, is it required to record the depth and area dimensions of material removed during a blend out repair or is it sufficient to simply record that the damage has been repaired as per the SRM?            



 Yes, the dimensions of the damage and the removed/remaining material should be recorded. This is a very important information in order to assess whether further damage (adjacent or at the same spot) at a later stage would be allowable or not. In addition, it is a safeguard measure in order to be able to determine, during audits, whether the person correctly determined that the damage was within limits.

                Can the subcontractor’s staff of a part-145 approved organisation issue an EASA Form 1?            



 One of the fundamentals of subcontracting activities is that, during such maintenance, the part-145 has been temporarily extended to include the subcontractor. Subcontracting can be done only if the part-145 has approved procedures to do it (145.A.75 (b)) and the MOE is amendment to show this new subcontractor.
A certificate of release to service can be signed by a person from the subcontractor who meets the part-145 approved maintenance organisation certifying staff standard approved in the MOE, which means:
The subcontractor’s staff (who does not need to hold a part-66 licence) must meet the authorisation criteria of the part-145 approved organisation, including the assessment of competence (knowledge, on-the-job performance and experience), continuation training and ongoing competency assessments.
The subcontractor’s staff must be authorised by the part-145 to issue an EASA Form 1
The certificate of release to service and the EASA Form 1 will always be issued under the maintenance organisation approval reference.

                Release to service of NDT tasks by part-145 organisations            



 
Part-145 organisation


Certifying staff required


Qualification system


General Release procedure


Release procedure for an NDT inspection


Aircraft
					(class A)
 


The release of the aircraft maintenance carried out under A class rating has to be performed by certifying staff holding a Part-66 licence.


Licencing of personnel has to follow Part-66 regulation.


The release is either on the aircraft technical log or issuing an aircraft release to service statement.


A Part-145 organisation holding an A approval rating on a particular aircraft type and having in its approved scope of work NDT inspections for this aircraft type.
 
This organization needs to have part-66 certifying staff and NDT personnel qualified in accordance with 145.A.30(f).
 
In this case the NDT inspector performs the NDT task and signs off the work order. The aircraft is released by appropriately qualified B1, B3 or C certifying staff under the organisation’s A rating.
 
Please note that the release  may include not only the NDT task but also the associated tasks (removal of panels, blankets, wires, re-installation, etc), or the NDT task may be part of a base maintenance check.


Engines
					Class B
 


The release of the engine maintenance carried out under B class rating has to be performed by engine’s certifying staff.


The certifying staff is qualified following the procedures established by the organisation, Part-66 licence is not required.


The release of works performed under class B is done on an EASA Form 1 (or by means of an internal release document when this component is for the organisation’s own use and the organisation has in place the related internal procedures in the MOE).


A Part-145 organisation holding a B rating approval on a particular engine type and having in its approved scope of work NDT inspections for this engine type.
This organization needs to have “engine” certifying staff (qualified in accordance with company procedures) and NDT personnel qualified in accordance with 145.A.30(f).
In this case the NDT inspector performs the NDT task and signs off the work order. The engine certifying staff releases the works performed to the engine (including NDT inspection) on an EASA Form 1.
 


Components
					Class C


The release of the component maintenance carried out under C class rating has to be performed by components certifying staff.


The certifying staff is qualified following the procedures established by the organisation, no need to have a Part-66 licence.


The release of works performed under class C is done on an EASA Form 1 (or by means of an internal release document when this component is for the organisation’s own use and the organisation has in place the related internal procedures in the MOE).


A Part-145 organisation holding a C rating approval on a particular component and having in its approved scope of work NDT inspections for this component.
This organization needs to have “component” certifying staff (qualified in accordance with company procedures) and NDT personnel qualified in accordance with 145.A.30(f).
In this case the NDT inspector performs the NDT task and signs off the Work Order / Engineering Order. The component certifying staff releases the works performed to the component (including NDT inspection) on an EASA Form 1.


Specialised services

The release of the maintenance carried out under D class rating has to be performed by “specialised services” certifying staff.

The certifying staff is qualified following the procedures established by the organisation in compliance with EN4179, Part-66 licence is not required.


The release of works performed under class D rating is done on an EASA Form 1 or using another form of release to service (other than aircraft release to service) as defined by the organisation in the MOE in compliance with 145.A.50 and approved by the competent authority.


A Part-145 organisation holding an D approval on a particular NDT method. The approved scope of work will be NDT inspections on this method.
This organisation needs to have NDT certifying staff qualified in accordance with 145.A.30(f).
In this case the NDT certifying staff performs and releases the NDT task on an EASA Form 1 or using another form of release to service (other than aircraft release to service) as defined by the organisation in the MOE in compliance with 145.A.50 and approved by the competent authority.

                    Maintenance data                  




        
            
                Shall the maintenance data be available and controlled at all times, even if there is no maintenance work going, or shall it be available only during the performance of maintenance?            



 Maintenance data has direct influence on many processes of the AMO and contributes to demonstrate the overall capability of the organisation to perform maintenance.
The maintenance data either can be arranged directly by the part-145 maintenance organisation (AMO) or provided by the customer/operator as specified by 145.A.45(a) and 145.A.45(g). In both cases, the AMO should demonstrate that the maintenance data used, regardless of the source, is up-to-date. To discharge this responsibility, a procedure should be established to:
(a) control the amendment status of any documents being used;
and
(b) regularly check that all amendments are being received, e.g. by subscribing to a document amendment scheme (sufficient in case of direct access to the maintenance data through the DAH/OEM. The subscription to the maintenance data distribution system of the customer/operator is insufficient, additional independent verifications through the original author shall be done).
When the maintenance data is arranged directly by the AMO it shall be available and controlled continuously.
There are certain situations when the maintenance data can be obtained only through the customer/operator. One of the examples would be the maintenance data for the large aircraft. The maintenance data coming from the TC holder is usually customised because of the model/configuration/modification/order of aircraft, so it is normally not possible for the AMO to have this customised maintenance data directly from TC holder without having an aircraft of that type under the contract.
When the maintenance data is provided by the customer/operator, it shall be held and controlled by the AMO during maintenance on the concerned aircraft/component. Whenever the maintenance data is not available or not current, the maintenance shall not be performed and released, as mentioned by 145.A.50(a) and 145.A.80 of the Regulation 1321/2014 correspondingly.
Additionally, as part of the obligation for maintenance records, used maintenance data shall be 
	- recorded (in compliance with 145.A.55(c)) 
	Remark: Manuals issued by the (S)TC (Supplementary Type Certificate) holder such as  AMM and CMM do not need to be stored as a record. Recording the revision status of such manual may be sufficient [AMC 145.A.55(c)].
	- accessible for auditing purpose 
	to demonstrate that the organisation worked in compliance with their respective requirements.

                    Personnel requirements                  




        
            
                Are the changes imposed by the EU Regulation 1149/2011 applicable to the Certifying staff qualified in accordance with Appendix IV to part-145?            



 The provisions of the paragraph 6 of the Article 6 of the Commission Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014 which were introduced by the Commission Regulation (EU) No 1149/2011 relating to the 10 years limit for obtaining the basic training/experience and 3 years requirement referred to in part-66 Appendix III para 1(a)(iv) relating to the type rating endorsement in part-66 Licence are not applicable to Certifying staff qualified in accordance with Appendix IV.
The practical type training is required in accordance with para 1 (e) of the Appendix IV to part-145, because in accordance with changes imposed by the Commission Regulation (EU) No 1149/2011, the type training shall consist of the theoretical training and examination and  practical training and assessment, as stated by item 1 of Appendix III to part-66.
On job training required by 66.45(c) is not applicable to the Certifying staff qualified in accordance with Appendix IV.

                Can a certification maintenance requirement (CMR) be performed by the Flight Crew before flight?            



 145.A.30(j)(3) is usually not applicable in case the CMRs included in an AD but it is not a “repetitive pre-flight airworthiness directive”,
145.A.30(j)(4) could be used for CMRs as long as all the applicable conditions are met. In particular:
The aircraft is away from a supported location.
Sufficient practical training has been carried out.
There is a procedure in the Maintenance Organisation Exposition.
The conditions of AMC 145.A.30(j)(4) are met (of other agreed with the competent authority which are consistent with this AMC). Please refer, in particular, to:
the point 2(i) where it says “minor maintenance or simple checks”, and
the point 2((i)e of this AMC, which states “Any check/replacement involving simple techniques consistent with this AMC and as agreed by the competent authority”

 As a consequence, the competent authority should assess that the test is simple and that all the other conditions mentioned in 145.A.30(j)(4) and associated AMC/GMs are met.

                What is the meaning of the Protected Rights in the Appendix IV to Part-145?            



 The protected rights mentioned in paragraph 2(a) of the Appendix IV to Part-145 were included in the Regulation 2042/2003 for the persons who were already working in a Part-145 organisation in a location situated outside the EU before the entry into force of Part-66. These protected rights allowed those persons to continue exercising (inside that particular Part-145 organisation) the privileges of the certification authorisation issued by that Part-145 organisation without the need to comply with paragraphs 1(c) to 1(f).
If this person changed the employment to a different Part-145 approved organisation after the entry into force of Part-66 (i.e. 28 November 2003), the previous certification authorisation is not valid and he/she needs to receive a new one from the new Part-145 approved organisation. In this case paragraph 2 of Appendix IV is not applicable anymore.
This implies that any new or extended authorisation granted by AMOs to their C/S after the entry into force of Part-66 must comply with paragraphs 1(c) to 1(f) in particular regarding the type training certificates.

 EASA is not a licensing authority and therefore does not issue any licences. Part-66 licences are issued by the competent authorities of the EU Member States, plus Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. The list of the National Aviation Authorities and their contact details can be accessed here: http://easa.europa.eu/the-agency/member-states .

                I want to work in an organisation located within the EU. Do I need a Part-66 licence?            



 According to the current rules, a Part-66 licence is required for:
certifying the release to service of maintenance of an aircraft;
work in maintenance organisations as support staff.
For other activities within a maintenance organisation, a Part-66 licence is not required. No Part-66 licence exists for components (based on article 5 of Commission Regulation (EU) No. 2018/1142).
Remark: Privileges on the basis of national requirements may be added in the Part-66 licence in section XIV. national privileges.

                I am a colour-blind. Does this prevent me from getting a Part-66 licence or exercising my licence privileges?            



 Regulation (EU) 1321/2014 does not require any medical examination before applying for a Part-66 licence.
In the past some medical criteria were proposed in JAR-66, but these were removed in order to avoid conflicts with national rules. JAR 66.A.50 had requirements on:
use of alcohol at work,
effects of medicines,
physical conditions, vision, ability to see colours,
mental conditions.
Part-66 has only a provision to suspend, limit or revoke licences in case of carrying out maintenance or issuing a certificate of release to service when adversely affected by alcohol or drugs [66.B.500 point(7)].
Current 145.A.30(e) requests certifying staff to receive a human factor training and GM 1 145.A.30 (e) gives guidance about the elements of the training to be imparted:
4 - Human performance & limitations
	4.1    Vision
	4.2    Hearing
	4.3    Information-processing
	4.4    Attention and perception
	4.5    Situational awareness
	4.6    Memory
	4.7    Claustrophobia and physical access
	4.8    Motivation
	4.9    Fitness/Health
	4.10  Stress
	4.11  Workload management
	4.12  Fatigue
	4.13  Alcohol, medication, drugs
	4.14  Physical work
	4.15  Repetitive tasks / complacency
Common sense recommends the certifying staff not to exercise the privileges of their certification authorisation if they know or suspect that their physical or mental condition renders them unfit to exercise such privileges (impact to the safe maintenance operations). In addition such recommendation may be covered and rendered mandatory by the national requirements of the Member State where you exercise your privileges. Typical examples are for intoxication (alcohol, drugs, etc.).
It is therefore recommended that you inform the management of your maintenance organisation:
as you should not deviate from the national law;
as the organisation shall establish and control the competence of personnel; (145.A.30(e) – necessary expertise related to the job function);
as the organisation shall have a human performance programme in place (145.A.35(e)); and
as the ICAO safety management system encourages to identify hazards and risks.
Please find an agreement with your company in order to list the maintenance tasks that you are allowed to carry out without jeopardising the aircraft safety.
Note: The same reasoning as explained above applies for any medical condition.

                Does EASA plan to propose changes to the implementing regulation to establish specific adaptations applicable to persons with learning difficulties (e.g. dyslexia, attention deficit disorder, hyperactivity,…) who wish to undertake aircraft maintenance training in a Part-147 approved training organisation as required to apply for Part-66 licenses?            



 Anybody able to pass the basic knowledge examinations and fulfil the basic experience requirements can get the related Part-66 licence. There are no additional conditions such as a medical certificate or any other proof regarding the mental or physical abilities. In other words, people with specific learning difficulties or physical impairments are not discriminated by Part-66 or Part-147.
Obtaining the licence does not give the certification privileges. Before granting such privileges, the maintenance organisation will have first to check the competence, including the assessment of the skills and abilities and considering the Human Factors principles. The scope of the certification authorisation will be commensurate to these competence/abilities. Please note that in some EU Member States additional occupational safety and health requirements may apply (working on heights, confined spaces, etc.).
EASA does not plan to propose amendments to the regulations to account for cases of people with special needs during examinations: a single regulation cannot cover all individual cases. If a Member State intends to introduce any such adaptation, Regulation EU 2018/1139 (the NBR) includes the possibility for the Member States to grant an exemption under the Article 71(2), after evaluation of the individual conditions for the case.
As an additional information, the Agency already issued several positive recommendations for such exemptions (e.g. for candidates with confirmed dyslexia, i.e. 25% additional time). Please contact your competent authority for details.
For further information about the flexibility provisions under the NBR, please see 'Safeguard & Flexibility Provisions'.

                How can I get a Part-66 licence valid in the EU by conversion?            



 Either you are the holder of:
a national licence [66.A.305] or an approved maintenance organisation authorisation [66.A.310], that was valid in the Member State before the entry into force of the EASA regulation introducing the relevant Part-66 categories (see entry into force of the amendments of the regulation), or
JAR-66 licence, which will automatically be re-issued as Part-66 licences as they are deemed to have been issued in accordance with Part-66. This does only apply to JAR-66 licence issued by the countries listed on the Mutual recognition page.
Furthermore, 66.A.70 allows conversion of qualifications valid in a Member State in very specific and limited cases.

                Which documentation is required to support the application demonstrating compliance with the experience requirements?            



 Maintenance experience should be written up in a manner that the reader has a reasonable understanding of where, when and what maintenance constitutes the experience. A task-by-task account is not necessary, but at the same time a bland statement such as “X years maintenance experience completed” would not be acceptable. A maintenance log book detailing the experience is desirable and some competent authorities may require such a log book (see AMC 66.A.10).  
Consequently, the format used to evidence the maintenance experience is not strictly defined in the rules and is left at the discretion of the competent authority issuing the licence. Hence, EASA advises you follow the instructions of the competent authority where you intend to apply for.

                Where do I gain the required basic maintenance experience? Is it mandatory to gain the required maintenance experience in an EASA approved Part-145 organisation?             



 It is not mandatory to gain maintenance experience in a Part-145 organisation. According to the AMC 66.A.30(a)(4), aircraft maintenance experience gained within different types of maintenance organisations (under Part-145, M.A. Subpart F, FAR-145, etc.) or under the supervision of independent certifying staff may be accepted by the competent authorities. This means that the aircraft maintenance experience may be accepted by the competent authority when such maintenance is performed in a maintenance organisation which does not necessarily hold an EASA Part-145 approval.
Furthermore aircraft maintenance experience gained outside a civil aircraft maintenance environment may include aircraft maintenance experience gained in armed forces, coast guards, police, etc., or in aircraft manufacturing. However, it is on the competent authority to evaluate whether this experience is acceptable.
Consequently, please contact the competent authority where you intend to apply for a licence, in order to check whether the basic experience would be acceptable.
See Part-66.A.30 and related AMC/GM.

                I work as a mechanic in the military field on aircraft being also certified for civil operations. In order to obtain the Part-66 licence, why do I need additional experience of civil aircraft maintenance as required by 66.A.30(e) on top of my experience in the military field?            



 As stated in 66.A.30(e), for mechanics having a military background and seeking a Part-66 licence, the objective is to ensure adequate understanding of the civil aircraft maintenance environment, not only because of possible different aircraft technologies, but also because of practices linked to the civil environment.
Not only the technology or systems of the civil aircraft might differ from the military aircraft version configuration (e.g. no video entertainment system; no sliding chutes; different fuel or electrical systems) but the experience gained in the military environment might also significantly differ from the  scope of work of the civil maintenance organisation, its procedures and policies (e.g. use and meaning of the certificate of release to service - EASA Form 1, standard parts, store and tools procedures, use of the maintenance documentation such as ADs, SB, SIL…, quality and safety management system; human factor aspects, continuing airworthiness record systems…).
In addition the interaction with the customers (i.e. the airliners) induces new practices such as use of the aircraft technical log book, MEL, aircraft defect rectification and deferment of items; use of customer documentation (e.g. MPD, MRB, SRM, IPC); interaction with the crew; how to behave with the passengers; special procedure such as (re)fuelling, de-icing /anti-icing; communication with the tower or moving on the apron.
Finally, the requirements for the continuing airworthiness of the aircraft  might significantly evolve in the civil environment. To name a few, the following items can be reminded: ADs, SBs, operational directives, EASA requirements; records and archives; repairs and modifications (use of data, EASA/FAA rules; dual-release); special inspections (e.g. CPCP, EWIS); approved maintenance programme and its effectiveness / reliability; occurrence reporting; understanding of MSG-3 methods …
The military regulations widely differ from country to country, with certain countries having military rules similar to the EU ones, while others have very different rules. The 12-month additional civil maintenance experience average  (as per AMC 66.A.30(e)), has been agreed by the Member States and accepted as a standard way to demonstrate compliance with the rule to achieve mutual recognition and adequate degree of standardisation.

                I have completed my EASA Part-66 modules for B1 and I have passed all the  exams, but I still lack experience to get my licence. Is there a time limit to get the licence ? Will the certificate expire in a few years if I do not get the experience?            



 According to Commission Regulation (EU) No 1149/2011 of 21 October 2011 (amending Regulation (EC) No 2042/2003), the basic examinations shall be passed and experience shall be acquired within the ten years preceding the application for an aircraft basic licence.
	The new regulation also states that for the purpose of time limits related to basic knowledge examinations, basic experience acquired before the Regulation applies, the origin of time shall be the date by which this Regulation applies, which is 01/08/2012 (which means until 31/07/2022).

                I hold a Category A1 Part-66 licence. What are the requirements to extend my licence to Category B1.1?            

Trending




 The requirements to extend a Part-66 licence with a category A1 to B1.1 are:
the knowledge demonstration of those basic modules, which are of higher level for B1.1 (see Part-66 Appendix I); and
the demonstration of experience required by Appendix IV to Part-66:
Two years of practical maintenance experience on operating aircraft in the B1.1 category (not in the A1 category) is needed before applying for the extension. This experience need to be accumulated within the 10 years preceding the application.
The experience requirement will be reduced by 50% if the applicant has completed an approved Part-147 course relevant to the category extension according to Appendix IV of Part-66.

                I already hold a Part-66 licence and I would like to include an additional basic (sub)category? Which additional (sub)modules are required to be passed for the addition of that new (sub)category?            



 According to 66.B.100(b), the competent authority shall verify that all required modules of Appendix I to Part-66 related to that new (sub)category sought are met. Credit can be granted as regards to the basic knowledge of the (sub)category for which the licence has been already issued.
This means that a comparison of the basic knowledge (gap analysis) will have to be done between the different (sub)categories. Such a comparison has not been yet done once and for all in Commission Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014 due to the different potential cases (wide diversity of (sub)categories).
Therefore such a comparison should be done by the Member State that has already issued the Part-66 licence, before the applicant is enrolled in such a “gap” basic knowledge course.
Please contact your competent authority, which may have already performed this comparison. Some competent authorities may have already posted such comparison(s) on their websites; however be sure that the comparison relevant to your case is acceptable to the competent authority who issued your licence.
In addition the applicant will have to comply with the additional experience requirements for the new (sub)category sought, as detailed in Appendix IV to Part-66.

                    Type ratings of a Part-66 licence                  




        
            
                What is a difference between examination and assessment? Why are there two different examination standards, respectively in Part-66 Appendix III, points 4 and 5?            



 Examination is a written form of demonstration of a certain level of theoretical knowledge by the student based on achievement of the learning objectives, usually performed on completion of a theoretical training course or a portion of a course. The student shall demonstrate, to the levels identified in the table in Appendix III, the detailed theoretical knowledge of the aircraft’s applicable systems, structure, operations, maintenance, repair, and troubleshooting according to approved maintenance data, as well as the use of manuals and approved procedures, including the knowledge of relevant inspections and limitations. The standard, format, pass mark, etc. are defined in Appendix III, 4.1. The examination shall be performed by the appropriately trained and approved examiner.
Assessment is a practical form of measuring the competence of the student by evaluating three major factors associated to the learning objectives: knowledge, skills and attitude, usually performed on completion of a practical training course.  The assessment should focus on the competencies relevant to the aircraft type and its maintenance. The principles on how to perform the competence assessments are given in the AMCs to Part-66, Appendix III. The assessment shall be performed by appropriately trained and approved assessors.
Regarding Part-66 Appendix III, point 5., “Type Examination Standard” does not apply to the examination performed as part of type training. This point only applies to those cases where type examination is performed as a substitute for type training, which means it is intended for the examinations conducted by (or on behalf of) the competent authority on those aircraft that do not require a type training (typically Group 2 and Group 3 aircraft according to Appendix I to the AMCs to Part-66). So, it is true that the examiners authorised by the competent authority shall not have been involved in the applicant's training. In all other cases AMC to Part-66 Appendix III applies, which means that the roles of  the assessor and the instructor may be combined for the practical elements, depending on the size of the organisation.
Regarding the roles of examiners and assessors, these are different functions (which does not prevent that one person can’t be authorised both as examiner and assessor). Normally, these functions should not be confused. The expression “The examination shall be oral, written or practical assessment based, or a combination thereof, …” applies only for Section 5, i.e. “Type Examination Standard”.

                I have passed the aircraft type rating training (TRT) in an approved EASA Part-147 organisation, although I have not completed the basic knowledge training. Is this TRT valid for life? Would it be possible to endorse it on my Part-66 licence as soon as I get one?            



 Aircraft type rating training must have been started and be completed within the 3 years preceding the application for a type rating endorsement (Part-66, Appendix III, paragraph 1 refers).
It does not make sense to attend in the first instance a TRT course with the intent of getting this TRT later endorsed on the maintenance licence for two main reasons:
at the time the TRT is gained, the holder has no licence and it may take more than 3 years before the applicant is compliant with the basic knowledge (66.A.25) as well as the experience requirements (66.A.30). Therefore the applicant runs the risk to get its TRT certificate expired at the time he applies for the licence and the TRT endorsement; and
From an intellectual point of view, this is not logical to demonstrate maintenance competence on a specific aircraft type without having acquired the basic knowledge, skills and attitude related to the maintenance and the technologies used in aviation in general.
Legally speaking the situation is not forbidden. However be sure that you get your licence within the 3-years’ timeframe from the date you passed the TRT course.

                I have attended a type training, may I immediately ask my authority to endorse it on my licence?            



 Yes, if the following conditions are met for the theoretical + practical parts of type training:
the course has been attended and the exams passed in a Part-147 approved training organisation,
or in another organisation, provided the course has been directly approved by the authority who issued the licence as per 66.B.130,
and for B1 and B2 licences, in case where the aircraft type is the first in a licence category or subcategory, an OJT training has been performed.

                I hold a licence with a type rating and I wish to add the rating of a similar aircraft of the same manufacturer. For example: I have a type rating on Airbus A320 Series, and I wish to add the rating on A330 Series. Do I need a complete course?            



 If aircraft types of the same manufacturer have different type ratings as stated in Appendix I to AMC to Part-66, there is a gap of knowledge gap preventing the endorsement of the second aircraft type. E.g. the Airbus A330 (GE CF6) is a different rating to the Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56).
If the Airbus A318/A319/A320/A321 (CFM56) is previously endorsed or the criteria for endorsement are met (based on conversion or type training) the  Airbus A330 (GE CF6) can be endorsed (within the time limits) following either
a complete theoretical + practical  Airbus A330 (GE CF6) course,  or
a differences training course, theoretical and practical for Airbus A330 (GE CF6) compared to  Airbus A318 (CFM56) (and/or A319/A320/A321) as described in Appendix III point 1(c).
Those training courses may either be provided by a Part-147 training organisation or by the competent authority.
Remark: A Part-147 organisation difference training is not required for variants within the same aircraft type rating, for example: from A320 to A321. Nevertheless, some training to cover the differences may be necessary. This may be provided by an approved maintenance organisation, before issuing the certifying staff authorisation, (see AMC to Paragraph 1(c) of Appendix III to Part-66 ‘Aircraft Type Training and Examination Standard. On-the-Job Training’).

                I just got an empty Part-66 licence. I plan now to get type ratings. Are 2 weeks practical training sufficient?            



 As per the new Regulation (EC) No. 1149/2011, the practical element of training is no longer a question of time. The duration of the practical training should be adequate in order to complete the contents required by paragraph 3.2 of Appendix III to Part-66.
For aeroplanes with a MTOM equal or above 30.000 kg the duration for the practical element of a type rating training course should not be less than two weeks.
In addition, for B1 and B2 licences, where the aircraft is the first in a licence category or subcategory, an on the job(OJT) training shall be performed.

                The Appendix III of Part-66 states that a type training course shall be started and finished within 3 years before the application for a type rating, is this still valid if I started the course before 1 August 2012?            



 Type training courses started and finished before 01 Aug 2012 can be used for rating endorsement application until 31 July 2015.
Any theoretical type training course finished after 01 Aug 2012 can be used for rating endorsement application until 3 years after they were started (even in the case where they were started before 01 Aug 2012).
Any practical type training course finished after 01 Aug 2012 can be used for rating endorsement application until 3 years after they were started (even in the case where they were started before 01 Aug 2012).

                Is it mandatory to go to a Part-147 approved training organisation to get type training? Can we do this training in a Part-145 approved organisation or at the aircraft manufacturer?            



 Only approved Part-147 organisations are entitled to conduct type training courses in accordance with Article 6 of the Commission Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014. However, according to Appendix III to Part-66, other than Part-147 organisation (including Part-145 maintenance organisations and manufacturers) can be approved by their competent authorities to provide theoretical element (theoretical training and examination) and/or practical element (practical training and assessment) of aircraft type training. This so called “direct” approval may be given by the competent authority in accordance with 66.B.130 provided:
This is a one-time approval on a case-by-case basis for a single course or a predefined group of courses i.e. Part-145 approved maintenance organisation cannot receive a permanent approval for aircraft type training.
The course and the assessment complies with the same standard valid for approved Part-147 organisations; this standard is described in paragraph 1 to 4 of Appendix III to Part-66.
No Part-147 Certificate of Recognition can be issued for the purpose of the mutual recognition[1] between Member States. However, an appropriate training certificates can be issued after successful completion of both elements.
Directly approved aircraft type training course is only valid for Part-66 AML type rating endorsement by that Member State, which means it cannot be used for aircraft type endorsement by other Member States (no mutual recognition of the certificate), unless this other competent authority has approved the course as well.

                (OJT) What is the meaning of the following statement in Part-66 Appendix III, Section 6: “The final assessment of the completed OJT is mandatory and…”?            



 The completeness of the whole OJT process shall be assessed. The intent of the requirement is not to suggest that:
there should be an assessment performed by the assessor on top of every task monitored by the supervisor; and/or
at the very end of the OJT programme, there should be a comprehensive hands-on assessment of the candidate on a real aircraft as an additional and ultimate evaluation
All report(s) or feedback from the supervisor(s) having monitored every actual job task performance or any other source of information (use of manuals and procedures; observance of safety measures, warnings and recommendations; adequate behaviour in the maintenance environment), the designated assessor should be in a position to:
ensure that the OJT procedure was fully met (in terms of objective and content); and
check that the competence of the candidate was positively assessed.
In case of doubt, the assessor may decide to proceed him/herself to an additional evaluation of the candidate or perform a gap analysis when the OJT procedure is not fully met such as an insufficient number of tasks or diversity of tasks or unclear supervisor’s report regarding the candidate’s performance. The supervisor should not sign the actual task if the person did not achieve the required competence in safe task performance.
Note: It is worth being reminded here that OJT addresses:
the first type rating in a (sub)category of aircraft; and
subsequently addresses young mechanics (e.g. “newcomers”) or mechanics having no experience in that new (sub)category of aircraft (e.g. extension of the license).
AMC to Section 6. of Appendix III to Part-66 gives more clarification about the assessment process and the function of the assessor:
“It is sufficient that the completion of individual OJT tasks is confirmed by the direct supervisor(s), without being necessary the direct evaluation of the assessor”, and
“The function of the assessor, as described in Section 6 of Appendix III to Part-66, is to conduct the final assessment of the completed OJT. This assessment should include confirmation of the completion of the required diversity and quantity of OJT and should be based on the supervisor(s) reports and feedback”.
It is left to the decision of the competent authority how to comply with this requirement: the AMC as suggested by the Agency aims at avoiding additional burden, duplication or over-regulation while proposing a simple final evaluation process.

                Tasks listed in Appendix II of Part-66 for an OJT are not suited to large aircraft. Shall we select the OJT tasks only from this list?            



 Not only, because it is required that:
the tasks for an OJT must be representative of the aircraft: this means that the tasks listed in Appendix II which are representative of the aircraft or another model in the type rating should be kept and those not representative be disregarded,
some tasks should be selected from each paragraph of the Appendix II list: this means that it is not necessary to perform exactly 50% in each ATA chapter,
new tasks more representative of the type of aircraft may be added by the maintenance organisation,
the OJT tasks should be selected because of their frequency, safety, novelty: tasks selected among those frequently carried out by the organisation on this type or more related to safety should be deleted.

                How tasks for OJT shall be selected for different licences?            



 The AMC states that the tasks are representative of the licence (sub)category applied for. This means that:
the tasks should identify whether they relate to a B1.1, B1.3 licence … or to a B2,
and be adapted to the privilege of each licence category / subcategory as defined in 66.A.20(a)3:
for a B1 licence: aircraft structure, powerplant and mechanical and electrical systems + work on avionics system with simple test but not including troubleshooting,
and those related to a B2: avionics, aircraft electrical system tasks and avionics/electrical tasks within mechanical and powerplant systems.

                Since the OJT is intended for the first aircraft type endorsement within a given licence (sub)category, does this mean that it can be performed on different aircraft types typical for that (sub)category?            



 OJT shall be performed on the aircraft type for which the applicant is seeking type endorsement. The objective of the OJT is to gain the required competence and experience in performing safe maintenance on that particular aircraft type.
However, a certain number of tasks may be performed on other aircraft type(s) (typically from the same manufacturer), only in the cases where such tasks are very similar to the tasks applicable to the aircraft type for which the candidate seeks the type endorsement. The AMC to section 6. of Appendix III to Part-66 states: “Tasks should be selected among those applicable to type of aircraft and licence (sub)category applied for.” Tasks applicable to the aircraft type may be found also on other aircraft types, perhaps not many, but some may fulfil the requirement. A good example would be same engine types installed on different aircraft types (i.e. CFM56 installed on A320 Family and B737). The location of LRUs, oil servicing, IDG, generator, filter change, engine standard practices, etc., those tasks often do not depend on the specific aircraft type (even could be performed off-wing or on spare engine), except the tasks belonging to the airframe - engine interface. The similar can also be applied for the same type of APU installed on different aircraft types or a limited number of other components/systems. Consequently, this may be acceptable, if properly justified to the competent authority within the MOE Chapter 3.15. This flexibility provision is applicable for a limited number of tasks and should not be used to conduct the entire OJT on other aircraft type(s) showing similarities.

                What should be the content of the OJT procedure in MOE chapter 3.15?            



 As agreed during the Standardisation Meeting with the competent authorities, as a minimum, the OJT procedure should describe the following elements:
Content of the OJT: the list of tasks that should be performed during the OJT or a list of generic tasks and the process how to develop a list of particular tasks out of this list of generic tasks,
Qualifications of the assessor and supervisors performing the OJT,
OJT logbook/worksheets format and content,
OJT compliance report format and content
Production planning for the implementation of OJT (how to plan the tasks),
Supervision process and the assessment process, what to do if the assessment is not positive,
Safe release to service of the aircraft after OJT.
Note: AMC to Section 6. of Appendix III to Part-66 should be used when defining the content of the procedure.

                I work in a maintenance organisation approved by the competent authority of a country different from the one who issued my Part-66 licence. An  OJT programme via MOE chapter 3.15 has been approved by the competent authority of my maintenance organisation. However, my licensing authority refuses to accept the OJT from the organisation I’m working for. Why? What shall I do?            



 Please review the extracted requirements here below from Part-66 Appendix III, Section 6:
‘On-the-Job Training (OJT) shall be approved by the competent authority who has issued the licence.’
‘It shall be conducted at and under the control of a maintenance organisation appropriately approved for the maintenance of the particular aircraft type’.
‘OJT shall cover a cross section of tasks acceptable to the competent authority’.
‘In order to facilitate the verification by the competent authority, demonstration of the OJT shall consist of:
detailed worksheets/logbook and
(ii) a compliance report demonstrating how the OJT meets the requirement of this Part.’

Since the procedure in MOE is approved by the competent authority of the maintenance organisation, it can only be used when the licensing authority is the same as the competent authority of the maintenance organisation. In other cases, the licensing authority may accept such OJT after assessing and approving the programme, which should usually be done prior to starting the OJT. This is described in AMC 66.B.115(c) states that “in the case where the licensing competent authority is different from the competent authority of the maintenance organisation which provides the OJT, your licensing authority may take into consideration the fact that the maintenance organisation has the OJT programme already accepted by their own competent authority (through chapter 3.15 of the MOE, as described in AMC 145.A.70(a))”.
Since your competent authority is responsible for the issue and extension of your licence, please follow the instruction of your competent authority and try to find a solution based on the above AMC.

                How can I carry out my OJT in a Part-145 approved maintenance organisation (AMO) whose principal place of business is located outside the EASA Member States?            



 The endorsement of the first aircraft type rating, within a given category/sub-category, requires satisfactory completion of the corresponding On-the-Job-Training (ref. 66.A.45.(c)).
The OJT shall be approved by the competent authority who has issued the licence (ref. Part 66, Appendix III, sec. 6).
It shall be carried out in a maintenance organisation approved under Part-145 (or M.A. Subpart F) with A rating and the procedures for OJT should be included in the exposition (MOE chapter 3.15 “OJT procedure”) approved by the competent authority of the maintenance organisation. However, since these procedures are approved by the competent authority of the maintenance organisation, and providing training is not one of the privileges of a maintenance organisation, they can only be used when the licensing authority (competent authority issuing the license) is the same as the competent authority of the maintenance organisation. In other cases, it is up to the licensing authority to decide whether it accepts such procedures for the purpose of approving the OJT (ref. AMC to Section 6 of Appendix III to Part-66).  
For the Part-145 AMOs, whose principal place of business is located outside the EASA Member states, the competent authority of the maintenance organisation is EASA. In such case, the OJT procedures cannot be included in the MOE, due to the fact that EASA is not a licensing authority. 
The possibility still exists in this case that a licensing authority may directly approve OJT procedures, which have to be included in a separate document outside (and not being part) of the MOE.
Consequently, personnel working in these AMOs, or the AMOs wishing to support its staff on this matter, should:
Option A: apply directly to the licensing authority who has issued the license for the approval of an OJT (to be proposed in a document outside the MOE). This option should normally be considered by organisations and not by individuals.
Option B: find an agreement to follow an already approved OJT at another organisation, which was approved by the same licensing authority who has issued the license. Possibility also exists to follow an OJT which was approved by any other licensing authority, however in such case the final acceptance of this OJT for the purpose of endorsing the first type rating in the license remains at the sole discretion of the competent authority issuing the license.
It is recommended that prior to starting any OJT, the licensing authority who has issued the license is contacted to verify its acceptance of any possible intended option.

                    Privileges of a Part-66 licence                  




        
            
                I am the holder of a B1.2 licence (i.e “aeroplane piston”). Can I exercise my privileges for piston-engine non-pressurised aeroplanes1 of 2000 kg MTOM and below (i.e. category B3)?            



 By default, a category B3 licence is included in a category B1.2 licence because the basic knowledge requirements (66.A.25(a)) and the basic experience requirement (66.A.30) for a B3 licence are covered by the similar requirements of a B1.2 licence.
Provided that the qualification requirements are fulfilled, the B1.2 licence holder can release maintenance tasks performed on piston-engine non-pressurised aeroplanes of 2000 kg MTOM and below.
In particular the B1.2 licence holder would have to meet 66.A.20(b), which means that:
the applicable requirements of Part-M and/or Part-145 will be complied; and
in the preceding two-year period he/she has 6 months of maintenance experience in accordance with the privileges granted by the aircraft maintenance licence or; met the provision for the issue of the appropriate privileges; and
he/she has the adequate competence to certify maintenance on the corresponding aircraft; and
he/she is able to read, write and communicate to an understandable level in the language(s) in which the technical documentation and procedures necessary to support the issue of the certificate of release to service are written.
AMC 66.A.20(b)  and GM 66.A.20(b)  gives further explanations on the 6-months maintenance experience in the last 2 years, including demonstration of experience on at least one aircraft type per aircraft structure (metal, composite or wood).1

                Can I have endorsed in my Part-66 licence aircraft types for which the Basic Regulation is not applicable?            



 The competent authority of the Member State issuing the licence may include in the Annex (Section XIV) of EASA Form 26 types for which the Basic Regulation is not applicable. The privileges endorsed for these types are based only on the national rules. The use of Section XIV of EASA Form 26 is optional.
EASA does not have any information about these types. If you want to get information about them, please contact the competent authority.

                Is there a requirement to have 6 months’ experience every 2 years to maintain the validity of the Part-66 licence?             



 No, the validity of the Part-66 licence is not affected by recent experience. The requirement of 6 months’ experience within the preceding 2 years ensures that privileges are exercised by certifying staff with sufficient recent experience.
If you do not meet the experience requirement anymore, you lose your rights to exercise your privileges of certifying staff or support staff. The licence itself is valid 5 years from the last renewal. Only the certification privileges are affected by the “recency” of experience.
To regain your experience, you may:
either continue to accumulate maintenance experience until you gain the missing time required, or
meet the provisions for the issue of appropriate privileges, which means:
going to a type-training course again, including OJT as necessary, or
when the aircraft does not require an individual training (aircraft belonging in Group 2, 3 or 4), pass a type-examination, including practical assessment (see GM 66.A.20(b)2).

Neither a short period of job training session nor an aircraft type refresher training are acceptable. 
	Demonstration of experience should be made on the particular or similar aircraft and the definition of a ‘similar’ aircraft is provided in the AMC to 66.A.20(b)2.

                As a category A certifying staff at line, can my authority allow me to carry out more tasks than those specified in AMC 145.A.30(g)?             



 The list of typical tasks to be carried out by a category A certifying staff at line shown in the AMC include a line r. stating: “Any other task agreed by the competent authority as a simple task for a particular aircraft type. This may include defect deferment when all the following conditions are met:
there is no need for troubleshooting; and
the task is in the MEL, and
the maintenance action required by the MEL is agreed by the competent authority to be simple.
When these conditions are met, your authority may allow other tasks to be carried out under AMC 145.A.30g.

                Shall a Part-147 approved organisation have a mandatory occurrence reporting system according to (EU) No.376/2014?            



 Article 4 of Regulation (EU) No. 376/2014 defines the persons and organisations obliged to report occurrences under the “mandatory reporting system”. Personnel working at/for organisations approved in accordance with EASA Part 147 are not listed in paragraph 6 of article 4, therefore such organisations are not required to implement mandatory/ voluntary reporting systems according to Regulation (EU) No. 376/2014. This does not prevent any organisation or person involved in aviation activities, including maintenance training activities, to report any safety occurrence or other safety information they consider relevant.
Such reports would be to the voluntary reporting system to be established by all competent authorities according to Article 5.2 of Regulation (EU) No. 376/2014.
Typically a Part- 147 approved training organisation having implemented an Safety Management System (SMS) on a voluntary basis would have such a voluntary occurrence reporting system.
The European Commission (EC) published Guidance Material  for Regulation EU No. 376/2014. Paragraph 3.3 further elaborates on the organisations affected by that regulation.
An online service developed by the EC allows organisations and individuals to report aviation safety occurrences to aviation authorities.

                Part-147 approved organisations can also give courses outside the scope of Part-66. Can these courses be certified? (e.g. continuation training for the purpose of the certifying staff privileges as required by 145.A.35, task training, NDT, engine run, HF, SMS, etc.)             



 Courses outside the scope of Part-66 cannot be part of the Approval Schedule of the approved Part-147 organisation. This does not prevent a training organisation to provide such courses. The scope, content and the delivery methods of these courses will not be reviewed by the Agency or the EASA Member States, as part of the audit scope of the Part-147 organisation. However, when Part-M or Part-145 requires the staff to be trained, the appropriateness of such training being delivered would be assessed during the audits of these particular organisations.

                How can I become an EASA aircraft maintenance instructor?            



 Part-147, in particular, 147.A.105 (f), state that the experience and qualifications of instructors, knowledge examiners and practical assessors shall be established in accordance with criteria published or in accordance with a procedure and to a standard agreed by the competent authority. There are no additional requirements or guidance published in EASA rules regarding the experience and qualification of instructors, except that it is recommended that potential instructors be trained in instructional techniques.
The eligibility of candidates to a permanent or temporary (contracted independent) instructor’s position must be assessed in regards to the minimum qualifications defined by the concerned Approved Part 147 Training Organisation. The Organisation’s procedures should detail these minimum qualifications and associated eligibility criteria in terms of technical knowledge, pedagogical and instructional skills and working experience.
EASA does not issue Instructor licences or equivalent, and permanent or contracted instructors can only exercise instruction privileges through the approval of a Training Organisation. Instructors are nominated by the approved organisation, which keep detailed records of their qualifications and are audited by the authority. Their authorised scope of activity is then stated on Terms of Reference provided to the instructors, as well as on the instructor/ examiners/ assessors approved list.
For any further questions, we advise you to contact the training organisation Quality Assurance Dept. and/ or the Competent Authority (the one who granted the approval), in order to enquire about the possibility to be nominated as an instructor.

                Should the Part-147 organisation’s quality system be audited?             



 147.A.130(b) states that the approved Part-147 organisation shall establish a quality system including:
an independent audit function to monitor training standards, the integrity of knowledge examinations and practical assessments, compliance with and adequacy of the procedures, and
a feedback system of audit findings to the person(s) and ultimately to the accountable manager referred to in 147.A.105(a) to ensure, as necessary, corrective action.
This means that the quality system itself should be independently audited. The competent authority cannot perform this function on behalf of the organisation.
Within its approved procedures, the organisation has to monitor the quality system’s procedures. This implies that quality system monitoring itself must be subject to internal audits:
No conflict of interest is allowed - it is not permitted that such a function be performed by quality system’s staff;
This can be also outsourced;
The right level of the auditor(s)’ position within the organisation shall be met in order to assure the objective of 147.A.130 (b)2. (e.g. conflict of hierarchy, which could hinder an efficient and transparent report to the accountable manager).
In addition, the audit programme/plan needs to reflect this regulatory aspect.
The EASA Flight Standard Directorate consistently applies that policy during their standardisation visits.

                    Basic training                  




        
            
                Is it possible to grant a Part-147 approval to a training organisation which intend to conduct only training on one or only several modules?             



 No, a Part-147 approval can only be granted to an organisation which plans to conduct training on all the modules related to a (sub)category of an aircraft maintenance licence, so that a full understanding of the training needs, interfaces and examination relative to that (sub)category of licence is achieved.
However, some modules may be sub-contracted as mentioned in 147.A.145(d).
It does not mean that the Part-147 organisation is not allowed to conduct courses on just one module. In particular, in the case of limitations resulting from the conversion process, limitations can be lifted through the teaching and/or examination of one module or a part of a module.

                I have completed a part of my basic training course (including some module examinations) in an approved Part-147 organisation. I’m moving to another country and would like to continue my basic training in a Part-147 organisation located in the country where I move in. Is this possible? What will happen with my certificates? Can I get the maximum reduction of the experience required for the Part-66 licence?            



 There are several scenarios possible depending on the particular case. Here are some most probable cases for category B1 or B2:
Case No 1 (baseline – standard case) :  The applicant completes the whole basic knowledge course (including the training, practical assessments and basic modules examinations) in an approved Part-147 maintenance training organisation.
Result: The Certificate of Recognition (CoR) of the basic course completion is issued by the organisation. The applicant can apply for the Part-66 licence with 2 years of maintenance experience.
Case No 2: The applicant completes the basic training in two different Part-147 AMTO (including the examinations).
Result: The CoRs for the successful examination of each individual module are issued (by different AMTO), but not the CoR for the basic course completion. The applicant does not benefit from the experience reduction and have to fulfil the requirement of 3 years of experience (if recognised as skilled worker) or 5 years.
It may happen that some of the competent authorities would give the complete credit on experience in case the applicant can prove that:the training completed in different organisation covers in total the Appendix I syllabus; and
all the practical assessments are performed and passed successfully; and
all interactions between the modules have been correctly addressed; and
there was a right proportion of theoretical and practical training for each subject.
As this demonstration requires a significant investment, the applicant is invited to directly contact the competent responsible for performing such an investigation.
Case No 3: The applicant has completed a full basic training course in one approved Part-147 organisation. Unfortunately, the candidate was not in a position to successfully pass the full  examination process (all modules) in that organisation and had to pass the missing portion of the examination in another approved Part-147 organisation.
Result: In this case the applicant would receive a CoR for basic training only as well as the CoRs related to the modules successfully passed in that approved Part-147 organisation. The examination for the missing modules may be successfully passed in another approved Part-147 organisation(s) with issuance of the related CoRs thereof. The combination of all these CoRs may be sufficient for the competent authority to recognise the training course as successfully “completed” and to grant the maximum credit for the experience (only 2 years needed) for the issue of the license.
Case No 4: The applicant did not attend a Part-147 basic training course but only took  examinations in one or more approved Part-147 organisation(s).
Result: The applicant would receive several CoRs for the successful examination of individual modules from one or more approved Part-147 organisations. No credit of experience as per 66.A.30 will be granted (except for skill workers – 3 years). Standard 5 years of experience will be required.
Further information is given in AMC to Appendix III to Part-147 “Certificates of Recognition referred to in Annex IV (Part-147) – EASA Forms 148 and 149.

                Is it possible to grant a Part-147 approval to a training organisation which intend to conduct only basic knowledge examinations?             



 No, a Part-147 approval can only be granted to an organisation which can prove its capability to conduct training and examinations on a complete syllabus of at least one (sub)category of the Part-66 licence. Only in the case the organisation holds the approval for the complete basic training course, it may conduct basic examinations not being an integral part of the approved basic training course.

                Is it possible to grant a Part-147 approval to an organisation applying only for basic knowledge training?            



 Yes, in such case Form 148 shall be used as template for the Certificate of Recognition, which specifies “Basic training course” or “Basic examination”. In the particular case where all modules are not conducted, (see next questions) the certificate shall state only “Basic examination” and the modules conducted be mentioned on the certificate including the date(s) of the examination(s).

                Part-147 approved organisations have the privilege to carry out basic examinations on behalf of the competent authority. Does this imply that the said authority has to supply or approve examination questions?             



 No, the competent authority does not have to supply examination questions. However, as part of the oversight, the authority must sample check and review the organisations' question data bank and the examination process.

                    Type training                  




        
            
                Is it possible to perform aircraft type training in two different organisations? Can I do my practical portion of the type training in a Part-145 organisation?            



 Only a Part-147 organisation has the privilege (if approved by its competent authority) to provide aircraft type training courses. This comprises both the theoretical and practical element of the aircraft type training, including the related examinations and assessments. This means that the practical element of the aircraft type training shall be completed in a Part-147 organisation.
However, the aircraft type training may be conducted physically in a Part-145 organisation under the control (and as a part of the approval) of a Part-147 organisation issuing the Certificate of Recognition. It is not the privilege of the Part-145 organisation to conduct aircraft type training courses on its own.
In addition, the theoretical and practical element of the aircraft type training can be conducted by two different approved Part-147 organisations. The competent authority endorsing the type rating on the license should be convinced that the interfaces have been correctly addressed before proceeding thereof (66.B.115(b) refers).
In the special case where the aircraft type course is directly approved by the competent authority in accordance with the procedure 66.B.130 (i.e. only on a case by case basis – special authorization not granted for long term periods), the training can be conducted outside the scope of a Part-147 organisation. As a consequence, the certificate issued is not mutually recognized between Member States, which means it can only be used for aircraft type endorsement by the licensing authority who issued that direct approval.

                How should the 50% of tasks required for practical training be selected? Should it be 50% of tasks as per glossary (e.g. LOC, FOT, SGH, R/I, etc.)?            



 The selection of 50% of tasks cannot be selected according to the glossary. Paragraph 3.2 of Appendix III to Part-66 clearly states that ‘the tasks selected shall be representative of the aircraft and systems both in complexity and diversity. In addition, the practical training should particularly address the tasks which cannot be explained by theoretical training only. While relatively simple tasks may be included, other more complex tasks shall also be incorporated and completed as appropriate to the aircraft type.
Regarding the way to read the table in paragraph 3.2, the lines aims at covering the main systems so that no line relevant to the particular aircraft type should be omitted in the selection. Inside each line applicable to the aircraft type, half or more of the crosses can be selected. From a learning point of view, selecting 2 simple tasks as LOC and SGH would not be “representative”, while selecting LOC and TS, for example, would be much more appropriate.
When selecting the tasks, the usage of filtering method based on the criteria similar to that described in AMC to paragraph 3.1(d) of Appendix III to Part-66, point 5 f) is recommended.

                What is the minimum duration of the practical element of the aircraft type training?            



 The duration of the practical training should ensure that the content of training required by paragraph 3.2 of Appendix III to Part-66 is completed. However, for aeroplanes with a MTOM equal or above 30000 kg, AMC to paragraph 1(b) of Appendix III to Part-66 recommends the duration of the practical element of a type rating training course be not less than two weeks, unless a shorter duration meeting the objectives of the training and taking into account pedagogical aspects (maximum duration per day) is justified to the competent authority. This means that the duration of the a/c type practical training is not the main driver as justified by the status of that AMC. According to point 3.2 (b) Appendix III to Part-66 (having the status of requirement), the duration should be based on the content sufficiently representative in diversity and complexity in order to gain the needed competence.

                Can an examination be limited to some modules only, or one module only or part of a module only?            



 As mentioned in the previous question, for some particular cases, the basic training need to be conducted and the relevant examination to be passed on some modules only or one module or part of a module (this is typically the case where the holder of a licence applies for removing some limitations mentioned in his/her licence).
However, the Part-147 organisation should be capable of conducting the full course relative to the (sub)category sought, so that they can run the examination.

                Should examiners be specialists in the subjects, or can they be responsible for the proper conduct of the examination without being responsible for the content?             



 “Examiner” should be here understood as “invigilator” (i.e. the personnel responsible for merely running the examination).
The examiners (invigilators) are not required to be experts in the subjects examined when relative to the MCQs in accordance with Appendix II to Part-66. However, the assessment  of essay questions as part of the basic knowledge has to be conducted by knowledgeable personnel with the help of a standard reply. Eventually, the invigilators must be trained to the examination process.
Examiners should demonstrate a clear understanding of the examination standard required by Part-66 and have a responsible attitude to the conduct of examinations such that the highest integrity is ensured. (GM 147.A.105(g)).
Regarding the type training examination and assessment standard as well as type examination standard as described in Part-66, Appendix III, paragraphs 4 and 5, the theoretical element examination can follow the same principle as above; however, for the practical element assessment, the examiner(s) must be appropriately qualified. Further provisions are available in Appendix III to AMC to Part-66.

                What is the maximum number of students attending the examination?            



 147.A.100(b) defines the facility requirements for the instructions of theory and the conduct of knowledge examinations. Point 1 deals with the facility requirement for knowledge training whereby the number of students shall not exceed 28. Point 2  defines the facility requirements for the examination purposes, where the maximum number of students attending the knowledge examination is not limited. The number of students attending the knowledge examination is indirectly limited only by the size, layout and arrangement of the accommodation in order to fulfil the following requirements:
 … no student can read the paperwork or computer screen of any other student from his/her position during examinations (147.A.100(b)2), and
Examination candidates shall be separated from each other so that they cannot read each other’s examination papers. (66.B.200(h)).
Consequently, as long as the facility and examination standard as well as the integrity of the examination can be ensured, the number of candidates attending the examination may not be limited. In case of a larger number of candidates, two or more examiners may be used to ensure the integrity of the examination, such as separation of the candidates, no potential cheating, no speaking to each other, only examination paper on the table, no examination paper removed from the room, etc.

                    Air Operations - General                  




        
            
                The definition of commercial operation according to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 Article 3 (Definitions) (i) is as follows: “commercial operation” shall mean any operation of an aircraft, in return for remuneration or other valuable consideration, which is available to the public or, when not made available to the public, which is performed under a contract between an operator and a customer, where the latter has no control over the operator.” In this context, what does the term “control” actually mean?             



 Reference: Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 (‘the Basic Regulation’)
The legislator has not further specified the term “control”. It is therefore EASA’s view that it should be understood in a wider sense, i.e. the term is not limited to operational control. In this sense, control could for example also encompass financial control, control of management decisions etc. This notion of the definition is for example particularly valid for managed operations or fractional ownership. These are operations where an aircraft is owned by one or several persons who contract a management company to manage operations and continuing airworthiness. It then depends on the specific contract between the owner(s) and the management company how much control the owner(s) still have over the operation.

                Would there be a restriction that requires baby bassinets to be removed and stowed during in-flight turbulent weather conditions? Where is it documented?            



 Reference: CS-25 (Large Aeroplanes)
Baby bassinets are currently included in a certification process of the particular aircraft in which they will be installed; baby bassinets are not certified as a separate device and they are not certified for taxi, take-off, landing and turbulent weather conditions. Placards advising on their stowage during taxi, take-off, landing and turbulence are required either at the location where baby bassinets will be fixed to the aircraft structure (e.g. bulkhead) or a clearly visible instruction advising on the same must be in place on the baby bassinet itself.
Because of the standard fixation of the unit, they are not stable during turbulence, they may swing up and down, and therefore they must be stowed during turbulence.
The placarding requirements are related to the general certification requirements on placarding and intended function in accordance with Certifications Specifications and Acceptable Means of Compliance for Large Aeroplanes CS-25 (ED Decision 2012/008/R) and the marking requirements as specified in the approval of the equipment. The applicable reference paragraph is CS 25.1301, 25.1541. There is no specific mention of baby bassinets, however, equipment installed in an aircraft must meet the applicable requirements of the certification basis, the equipment specifications (if available) or aircraft manufacturer specifications (if available), or NAA requirements applicable to the operation of the aircraft.
For any questions on certification matters, do not hesitate to contact EASA Certification directorate.

                What is the 'Basic Regulation'?            



 Reference: Regulation (EC) No 216/2008
The 'Basic Regulation' (BR) designates Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 2008 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Aviation Safety Agency, and repealing Council Directive 91/670/EEC, Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 and Directive 2004/36/EC, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 690/2009 and Regulation (EC) No 1108/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009. A consolidated version of the Basic Regulation can be found here.
Under the EU legal order, the Basic Regulation has general application. It is binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States. The main objective of the BR is to “establish and maintain a high uniform level of civil aviation safety in Europe” - Article 2 (1). Additional objectives are, among others, to ensure a high uniform level of environmental protection, to facilitate the free movement of goods, persons and services and to provide a level playing field for all actors in the internal aviation market” - Article 2 (2) (a), (b) and (f). One of the means to attain such objectives is “the preparation, adoption and uniform application of all necessary acts” - Article 2 (3) (a).
For that purpose, the BR conferred to the European Commission the power to adopt implementing rules which will detail how to comply with the essential requirements of the BR and will regulate the subject matters included in the its scope: airworthiness of aircraft, environmental protection, pilots, air operations, aerodromes, ATM/ANS, Air Traffic Controllers and aircraft used by third country operators into, within or out of the Community - see, among others, item 38 of the preamble to the BR.
One of EASA's (the Agency) tasks is to assist the Commission in the adoption of implementing rules, under Articles 18(a) and 19 BR.
Therefore, Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, as last amended, has been termed as the Basic Regulation in the Agency's documentation. The implementing rules proposed by the Agency take the form of Opinions addressed to the Commission. Once approved under the Comitology procedure, such implementing rules are published as Commission Regulations and this term appears in their titles.
Further FAQs on the Basic Regulation are available here.

                What are the essential requirements?            



 Reference: Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations as amended by Regulation (EU) No 800/2013
Essential requirements are a legal means of setting high level objectives and obligations on authorities, persons and organisations in order to achieve the objectives of the Basic Regulation ((EC) No 216/2008). Implementing rules are then developed on the basis of these essential requirements, to further detail how to achieve these objectives and obligations. The Basic Regulation has annexes containing essential requirements for:
airworthiness (in Annex I),
certain aircraft that fall outside the scope of the Agency's activities (Annex II),
pilot licensing (Annex III),
air operations (Annex IV),
qualified entities in the case of certification (Annex V),
aerodromes (Annex Va) and
ATM/ANS and air traffic controllers (Annex Vb).
For example, the implementing rules for air operations (e.g. Regulation (EU) No 965/2012) are developed using the essential requirements as a starting point. For certain aspects and types of operation, the essential requirements do not need to be further elaborated on with a specific implementing rule. For example, in the case of non-commercial operations with other-than-complex motor-powered aircraft, some of the responsibilities of the pilot-in-command are set out in adequate detail in 1.b and 1.c of Annex IV to the Basic Regulation, and did not need to be further detailed in implementing rules. For legal certainty, the essential requirements should not be repeated in the implementing rule, but to support industry in identifying the requirements with which they should comply, the Agency makes a reference to the essential requirement from the implementing rule:
	“NCO.GEN.105 Pilot-in-command responsibilities and authority
a) The pilot-in-command shall be responsible for:
(1) the safety of the aircraft and of all crew members, passengers and cargo on board during aircraft operations as referred to in 1.c of Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008”.

                What do 'grandfathering', 'transition measure' and 'opt-out' mean?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011, Regulation (EU) No 290/2012, Regulation (EU) No 965/2012, Regulation (EU) No 800/2013, Regulation (EU) No 71/2014, Regulation (EU) No 83/2014
Aircrew Regulation
In the Aircrew Regulation, 'grandfathering' designates the legal recognition and acceptance of certificates issued by national authorities prior to the entry into force of the Aircrew Regulation. In the Cover Regulation, the conditions for the grandfathering of JAR-compliant and non-JAR compliant pilot licences and medical certificates are set forth in its Articles 4 and 5.
Grandfathering measures are included in the Cover Regulation to assist Member States in the transition from national rules to unified EU rules. In the case of aircrew licensing, provisions on grandfathering consider some national certificates issued in compliance with given regulations and by a certain date as being in compliance with the new Aircrew Regulation.
A 'transition measure' is a means of allowing a gradual change to the new rules and its scope and timeline are clearly stated within the Cover Regulation. Several examples can be found in the Aircrew Regulation, such as in Article 11c (in relation to the obligation of Member States regarding transfer of records and certification processes of those organisations for which the Agency is the competent authority) and Article 4 (1) obligation of Member States to adapt grandfathered pilot licences to the new licence format by a certain date of the Cover Regulation. 
	The 'opt-out' can also be considered as a form of transition measure applicable to Member States. Opt-out provisions allow Member States to decide not to implement the new EU Regulation for a certain period of time, delaying the date of applicability of the new regulation within that Member State. This requires the Member State to notify the European Commission and the Agency of the 'opt-out', describing the reasons for such derogation and the programme for implementation. Article 12 (1) of the amended Cover Regulation allowed for a general opt out to Annexes I to IV until 8 April 2013. Other specific opt-outs are listed in Article 12 (2) to (6).
Air OPS Regulation
In the Air OPS Regulation, 'grandfathering' designates the legal recognition and acceptance of certificates issued by national authorities prior to the entry into force of the Air OPS Regulation. In the Cover Regulation, the conditions for the grandfathering of EU-OPS AOCs are set forth in Article 7.1.
	Grandfathering measures are included in the Cover Regulation to assist Member States in the transition from EU-OPS to the new air ops rules. In the case of air operations, provisions on grandfathering consider EU-OPS AOCs issued in compliance with given regulations and by a certain date as being in compliance with the new Air OPS Regulation.
A 'transition measure' is a means of allowing a gradual change to the new rules and its scope and timeline are clearly stated within the Cover Regulation. An example to be found in the Air OPS Regulation is Article 7.1 obligation of Member States to issue AOC complying with the new format by a certain date.
The 'opt-out' can also be considered as a form of transition measure applicable to Member States. Opt-out provisions allow Member States to decide not to implement the new EU Regulation and its amendments for a certain period of time, delaying the date of applicability of the new regulation within that Member State. This requires the Member State to notify the European Commission and the Agency of the 'opt-out', describing the reasons for such derogation and the programme for implementation. Article 10.2 of the Cover Regulation ((EU) No 965/2012) allows for a general opt out to Annexes I to V until 28 October 2014. The amendments to Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 have different dates of applicability.

                What do 'enter into force' and 'applicability' mean in the Cover Regulation?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 on Aircrew and its amendments, Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations and its amendments
When Regulations are published in the Official Journal of the European Union they invariably include several dates. The date of entry into force is usually expressed as the 20th day following publication of the Regulation in the Official Journal of the European Union. It means that the EU rules have been adopted and published - thus producing legal effects -, but are not necessarily mandatory on the date of entry into force. The date when they become mandatory is the date of applicability.
The Aircrew Regulation applies from 8 April 2012.
The Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations applies from 28 October 2012. Its further amendments have different dates of entering into force and of applicability.
However, since Article 12 of the Aircrew Regulation and Article 10 of the Air OPS Regulation include several opt-out provisions, this means that entire Annexes and/or specific parts of the Annexes will not be applicable until the end of the out-out periods, in case Member States take up this possibility. This means that the entry into force and applicability dates are common to all Member States, but due to the possibility of opt-outs, concrete implementation of specific provisions of Annexes or entire Annexes may vary among Member States. Please find Derogations to Aircrew Regulation ((EU) No 1178/2011, (EU) No 290/2012) and Air Operations Regulation ((EU) No 965/2012 and (EU), No 800/2013) here.

                When will the new rules on air operations be applicable?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations and its amendments
Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 entered into force on 28 October 2012.
Article 10 of the Air OPS Regulation includes an opt-out provision allowing Member States to postpone the applicability of Annexes I to V until 28 October 2014. This means that entire Annexes and/or specific parts of the Annexes will not be applicable if a Member States chooses to opt-out. The Agency has published an overview of the opt-out period applied by Member States here.
The amendments to the Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 have different applicability dates:
Commission Regulation (EU) No 800/2013 on non-commercial operation became applicable on 25 August 2013 and the opt-out period is 3 years.
Commission Regulation (EU) No 71/2014 on operational suitability data was published on 27 January 2014; it entered into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication and must be applied not later than 18 December 2017 or two years after the approval of the operational suitability data, whichever is the latest.
Commission Regulation (EU) No 83/2014 on flight and duty time limitations and rest requirements was published on 29 January 2014, entered into force on the twentieth day following that of its publication and shall apply from 18 February 2016 and from 17 Feb 2017 for ORO.FTL.205(e).
Once the Implementing Rules have been adopted, it is still possible that transition measures defer their applicability to a later date. Therefore, the exact date of applicability of each requirement will depend on the transition measures adopted by the European Commission. Until the date the new Implementing Rules apply, Member States' national rules and EU-OPS remain in force.

                What is the comitology procedure?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 182/2011
Under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the European Commission is responsible for the required implementation of Union legislation in many areas. When exercising these delegated powers, the Commission is often obliged to work with national civil servants appointed by Member States in different committees. These committees, which are a forum for discussions and the voicing of opinions, are chaired by the European Commission.
For the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 (the Basic Regulation), the European Commission is assisted by the EASA Committee and by the Single European Sky Committee. Another committee of importance as regards aviation safety is the Air Safety Committee, which is best known for being the guardian of the so-called 'Safety list' as provided by Directive 2004/36/CE of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on the safety of third-country aircraft using Community airport as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2111/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2005 on the establishment of a Community list of air carriers subject to an operating ban within the Community and on informing air transport passengers of the identity of the operating air carrier, and repealing Article 9 of Directive 2004/36/EC.
The procedures which govern the work of these committees follow the standard procedures approved by Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 laying down the rules and general principles concerning mechanisms for control by Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers. It replaces former Decision 1999/468/EC. This Regulation introduces a new amended 'comitology' procedure. The latest Comitology Regulation and other relevant information on the new comitology procedure can be consulted here.

                Why can't I find EU-OPS on the Agency website?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations, associated Decisions (AMC/GM)
EU-OPS is published in the Official Journal of the EU as Regulation (EC) No 1899/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 amending Council Regulation (EEC) No 3922/91 on the harmonisation of technical requirements and administrative procedures in the field of civil aviation (OJ L 377, 27.12.2006, p. 1). It is available online via EUR-Lex. Although the Agency assists the Commission in administering this Regulation, any enquiries related to EU-OPS, if not handled by your national aviation authority, should be addressed to the Commission.
The JAA published TGL 44 in 2008, containing extensive guidance material for use with EU-OPS. This is available online.
EU-OPS continues to apply until the new requirements of Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations and its amendments are applicable in your Member State.

                What is the status of 'Implementing Rules', 'Acceptable Means of Compliance' (AMC), ‘Certification Specifications’ (CS), Alternative Means of Compliance (AltMOC), 'Guidance Material' (GM), ‘Special Conditions’ and 'Frequently Asked Questions'(FAQ)?             



 Implementing rules (IRs) are binding in their entirety and used to specify a high and uniform level of safety and uniform conformity and compliance. The IRs are adopted by the European Commission in the form of Regulations. EU law is directly applicable (full part of Member States' legal order).
Detailed implementation aspects are included as Certification Specifications (CS) or Acceptable Means of Compliance (AMC). 
Acceptable Means of Compliance (AMC) are non-binding. The AMC serves as a means by which the requirements contained in the Basic Regulation and the IRs can be met. The AMC illustrate a means, but not the only means, by which a requirement of an implementing rule can be met. Satisfactory demonstration of compliance using a published AMC shall provide for presumption of compliance with the related requirement; it is a way to facilitate certification tasks for the applicant and the competent authority. However, NAAs and organisations may decide to show compliance with the requirements using other means. Both NAAs and the organisations may propose alternative means of compliance (AltMoCs). ‘Alternative Means of Compliance’ are those that propose an alternative to an existing AMC. Those AltMoC proposals must be accompanied by evidence of their ability to meet the intent of the IR. Use of an existing AMC gives the user the benefit of compliance with the IR.
Read more on the difference between AMC and AltMoC.
Certification Specifications (CS) are non-binding technical standards adopted by EASA to meet the essential requirements of the Basic Regulation. CSs are used to establish the certification basis (CB) as described below. Should an aerodrome operator not meet the recommendation of the CS, they may propose an Equivalent Level of Safety (ELOS) that demonstrates how they meet the intent of the CS. As part of an agreed CB, the CS become binding on an individual basis to the applicant.
Special Conditions (SC) are non-binding special detailed technical specifications determined by the NAA for an aerodrome if the certification specifications established by EASA are not adequate or are inappropriate to ensure conformity of the aerodrome with the essential requirements of Annex VII to the Basic Regulation. Such inadequacy or inappropriateness may be due to:
the design features of the aerodrome; or
where experience in the operation of that or other aerodromes, having similar design features, has shown that safety may be compromised.
SCs, like CSs, become binding on an individual basis to the applicant as part of an agreed CB.
Guidance Material (GM) is non-binding explanatory and interpretation material on how to achieve the requirements contained in the Basic Regulation, the IRs, the AMCs and the CSs. It contains information, including examples, to assist the user in the correct understanding and application of the Basic Regulation, its IRs, AMCs and the CSs.
Frequently Asked Questions: FAQs are published on the EASA website and cover a wide range of material. Although the information contained in the FAQs is a summary of existing law or procedures, it may contain the results of a more complex interpretation of IR or other rules of law. In such cases there is always an internal quality consultation within the Agency prior to the publication of the FAQ on the website. The EASA FAQs are necessary to share information and enable to get a common understanding.
The FAQs are not additional GM.

                Does Reg. (EU) No 965/2012 on air operations also apply to non-commercial operations?            



 References: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on air operations as amended by Regulation (EU) No 800/2013; Reg. (EC) No 216/2008 
Yes, non-commercial operations with aeroplanes and helicopters are covered by Reg. (EU) No 965/2012 on air operations. The applicable rules are determined by the complexity of the aircraft being used: Annex VI (Part–NCC) applies to non-commercial operations with complex motor-powered aircraft) and Annex VII (Part–NCO) applies to non-commercial operations with other-than-complex motor-powered aircraft. 
The definition of complex motor-powered aircraft is found in Article 3 of  Reg. (EC) No 216/2008 and is as follows:
“complex motor-powered aircraft' shall mean:
(i) an aeroplane:

with a maximum certificated take-off mass exceeding 5 700 kg, or
certificated for a maximum passenger seating configuration of more than nineteen, or
certificated for operation with a minimum crew of at least two pilots, or
equipped with (a) turbojet engine(s) or more than one turboprop engine, or
(ii) a helicopter certificated:

for a maximum take-off mass exceeding 3 175 kg, or
for a maximum passenger seating configuration of more than nine, or
for operation with a minimum crew of at least two pilots,
or
(iii) a tilt rotor aircraft”.

The definition for 'commercial operation' is in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 965/2012:
“(1)(d) 'commercial operation' means any operation of an aircraft, in return for remuneration or other valuable consideration, which is available to the public or, when not made available to the public, which is performed under a contract between an operator and customer, where the latter has no control over the operator”.
Training flights fall under either Part-NCC or Part-NCO, depending on the complexity of the aircraft used for the non-commercial operations.
In addition, Part-SPA applies to any operation requiring a specific approval (e.g. low visibility operations, transport of dangerous goods, performance-based navigation and more).
Finally, Annexes II (Part-ARO) and III (Part-ORO) contain the authority requirements and respectively the organisation requirements. Annex III applies to operators of complex motor-powered aircraft, both commercial and non-commercial.

                How can I find out where a rule from EU-OPS / JAR-OPS 3 has been transposed in the new Regulation (EU) 965/2012 on Air Operations and its amendments, as well as its associated Agency Decisions, and if any changes have been introduced?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations, associated Decisions (AMC/GM)
The Agency has published a cross-reference table to assist industry in transitioning to the new rules. This table contains detailed information on the transposition of EU-OPS / JAR-OPS 3 provisions (both Section 1 and Section 2 - for aeroplanes, TGL 44) into the new Implementing Rules (IR), Acceptable Means of Compliance (AMC) and Guidance Material (GM):
new rule reference and rule title;
old rule reference and rule title;
indication of any differences to EU-OPS / JAR-OPS 3 provisions by stating “No change”, “Amended”, “New” or “Not transposed”; and
short description of the differences, if any, between the old and new rules.
With this cross-reference table one can analyse in detail where and how the old provisions have been transposed into the new regulatory framework.

                Which operational requirements (EU/EASA Parts) apply to flight activities carried out by Manufacturer (i.e. ferry flights, demonstration flights, etc.)?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations
At the present stage no EU requirements exist for flights related to design and production activities (“manufacturer flights”). Instead these flights are regulated under national law. This is laid down in Paragraph 3 of Article 6 of Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 as follows:
“By way of derogation from Article 5(1) [air operations are regulated on a EU level], flights related to the introduction or modification of aircraft types conducted by design or production organisations within the scope of their privileges shall continue to be operated under the conditions set out in Member States' national law.”
However, the Agency started a rulemaking task (RMT.0348/0349) on “Flights related to design and production activities”. The goal is to establish a European regulatory framework for manufacturer flights including ferry flights, demo flights etc. At the present stage, a rulemaking group is working on a draft proposal to be published as “Notice of Proposed Amendments (NPA)” in 2014.

                What are critical phases of flight?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012, Annex I Definitions
Annex I (Definitions) of the Regulation (EU) 965/2012 on air operations contains definitions for critical phases of flight for aeroplanes and helicopters:
“'Critical phases of flight' in the case of aeroplanes means the take-off run, the take-off flight path, the final approach, the missed approach, the landing, including the landing roll, and any other phases of flight as determined by the pilot-in-command or commander.
'Critical phases of flight' in the case of helicopters means taxiing, hovering, take-off, final approach, missed approach, the landing and any other phases of flight as determined by the pilot-in-command or commander.”
As one can see from these definitions, for helicopters taxiing is defined as a critical phase of flight, while for aeroplanes it is not. Rules for activities considered acceptable during critical phases of flight are provided in the Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on air operations – in Annex III (Part-ORO), Annex IV (Part-CAT), Annex VI (Part-NCC), Annex VII (Part-NCO) and Annex VIII (Part-SPO). Basically, these implementing rules require crew members during critical phases of flight:
to be seated at his/her assigned station; and
not to perform any activities other than those required for the safe operation of the aircraft

                What are 'Sterile Flight Deck Procedures'?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations, Annex I (Definitions) and Annex III (Part-ORO)
The term 'Sterile Flight Deck' is used to describe any period of time when the flight crew members shall not be disturbed e.g. by cabin crew, except for matters critical to the safe operation of the aircraft and/or the safety of the occupants. In addition, during these periods of time the flight crew members should focus on their essential operational activities without being disturbed by non-flight related matters, i.e. flight crew members should avoid non-essential conversations, should not make non-safety related announcements towards the passengers, etc.
Sterile flight deck procedures are meant to increase the flight crew members' attention to their essential operational activities when their focused alert is needed, i.e. during critical phases of flight (take-off, landing, etc.), during taxiing and below 10 000 feet (except for cruise flight).
The sterile flight deck procedures were published in Regulation (EU) 2015/140 as an amending regulation to (EU) No 965/2012 on air operations. EASA published the associated AMC and GM with ED Decision 2015/005/R.

                What is the difference between 'commercial operation' and 'commercial air transport (CAT) operation'?            



 Reference: Regulation (EC) No 216/2008, Regulation (EU) No 965/2012
The term 'commercial operation' is now defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 as follows (previously in Reg. (EC) No 216/2008):
“'Commercial operation' means any operation of an aircraft, in return for remuneration or other valuable consideration, which is available to the public or, when not made available to the public, which is performed under a contract between an operator and a customer, where the latter has no control over the operator.”
The term 'commercial air transport (CAT) operation' is defined in Article 3 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 as follows:
“'Commercial air transport' means an aircraft operation to transport passengers, cargo or mail for remuneration or other valuable consideration.”
The two definitions make it clear that 'commercial operations' include 'CAT operations'. Specialised operations (SPO) are another type of commercial operations. They are also defined in Article 2 of Reg. (EU) No 965/2012.

                    Part-ARO                  




        
            
                AMC2 ARO.GEN.305(c) Oversight programme (c) stipulates that audits should include at least one on-site audit within each oversight planning cycle. What is meant by an 'on-site audit' in this sentence? Could it be so that every audit undertaken by an NAA could be performed while sitting in the NAA's office and reviewing operator's documents and procedures and only one of those audits should be undertaken in a way that NAA inspectors actually visit an operator on-site?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations, Annex II (Part ARO, ARO.GEN and ARO.RAMP)
There is no further guidance on how many on-site audits should actually be performed. This decision depends on the confidence of the authority in the operator, on results of past certification and/or oversight activities required by ARO.GEN and ARO.RAMP and on the assessment of associated risks. The number of on-site audits is therefore part of the oversight responsibility of the authority.

                How do the provisions on wet-leasing articulate with Regulation (EU) No 452/2014 on Third Country Operators (TCO)?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012, Annex III (Part ORO)
The TCO authorisation issued by the Agency is no substitute for requirements regarding wet-lease agreements between EU and third country operators that are contained in Part ORO of Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations. For wet-lease agreements, the TCO operator must demonstrate equivalence to EU safety requirements. Before entering into a wet-lease agreement, the EU operator should demonstrate to the authority that (1) the TCO has a valid AOC, (2) that safety standards of the TCO regarding continuing airworthiness and air operations are equivalent to the EU continuing airworthiness requirements of Reg. (EU) No 1321/2014 and (3) the aircraft has a standard Certificate of Airworthiness (CofA) issued in accordance with ICAO Annex 8.

                Must the competent authority check and approve the content of the operator's Safety Management Manual?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations, Annex II (Part ARO), Annex III (Part ORO)
As stated in ORO.AOC.100, an operator has to submit, as part of its application for an AOC, a description of its management system, including the organisational structure, which constitutes its safety management manual, whose content is described in AMC1 and AMC2 to ORO.GEN.200(a)(5).
	The Competent Authority has to check the content of the operator's Safety Management Manual (SMM) as mentioned in ARO.GEN.310(a) and in the corresponding AMC to ARO.GEN.310.
Information on the content of the operator's Safety Management Manual (SMM), which can be part of the Operations Manual or included in a separate manual, can be found in AMC1 and AMC2 to ORO.GEN.200(a)(5). It should be noted that the SMM is not required to be approved according to ORO.GEN.200(a)(5) and the related AMCs. Nevertheless, changes affecting the operator's management system are required to be approved (ORO.GEN.130 + GM1) and these changes would have to be reflected in the operator's manual dealing with Safety management.

                How do the provisions on code-sharing articulate with the  Regulation applying to Third Country Operators (Part TCO)?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012, Annex III (Part-ORO)
Regarding code-sharing, Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on air operations requires from the EU Operator, who wishes to enter into a code-sharing agreement with a third country operator (TCO), compliance with the requirements of Annex III to Regulation (EU) No 965/2012. This means the TCO as a code-share partner will undergo comprehensive audits for the initial verification of compliance and continuous compliance with the applicable ICAO standards [AMC1 ORO.AOC.115(a)(1)]. These audits can be performed either by the EU operator itself or a third party provider. The AMC (AMC2 ORO.AOC.115(b)) refers to the possibility of using industry standards. The audit will focus on the operational, management and control systems of the TCO (see AMC1 ORO.AOC.115(a)(1)).
Continuous compliance of the code-sharing TCO with the applicable ICAO standards will be performed on the basis of a code-share audit programme (see AMC1 ORO.AOC.115(b)).
This means that the audit and verification requirements contained in Part-ORO of Regulation 965/2012 cannot be substituted by a TCO authorisation issued by the Agency. For code-share, an EU operator must, in addition to the TCO authorisation, audit and monitor the TCO.

                ORO.GEN.110 (a): “The operator is responsible for the operation of the aircraft in accordance with Annex IV to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008”. Is this requirement met when an Operator follows the Implementing Rules (965/2012)?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations, Annex III (Part-ORO)
The Essential Requirements (ER) are as applicable as the implementing rules.
The operators are responsible for checking that they comply with all the Essential Requirements contained in Annex IV of the Regulation (EC) 216/2008.
Some implementing rules make a direct reference to the Essential Requirements. This is the case when an ER is not further developed in the implementing rules.

                What are the responsibilities of the AOC holder  required to implement a management system in accordance with ORO.GEN.200 in regards to continuing airworthiness management and contracted maintenance?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations, Annex III (Part-ORO); Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014 on continuing airworthiness, Part-M
1. Continuing airworthiness management
The EU licensed air carrier hereafter referred to as ‘the operator’, needs to consider both the relevant Part-ORO rules that will become fully applicable on 29 October 2014 and the applicable Part-M requirements. For these operators, the Part-M Subpart-G approval is an integral part of the AOC (as defined in Part-M, M.A.201(h)).
The Part-M requirements have not yet been amended to align with the management system framework adopted for air operations. However the operator should ‘scrutinise’ all its activities under its hazard identification and risk management processes, including the continuing airworthiness activities. It is the operator’s responsibility to ensure that hazards entailed by any continuing airworthiness management task are subject to the applicable hazard identification procedures and that related risks are managed as part of the operator’s management system procedures.
If the operator’s continuing airworthiness activities do not comply with the new management system requirements adopted with Part-ORO the competent authority may not raise any finding in reference to Part-M Subpart G, but may do so under Part-ORO should it consider that the operator’s safety risk management process does not sufficiently capture those risks stemming from the continuing airworthiness management activities that may impact the safety of operations. The integration of safety management across all activities will lead to increased efficiency and effectiveness in hazard identification and risk management as compared to a system where activities are being dealt with in isolation through separate management systems. This will improve the assessment of risks identified and ensure better allocation of resources to address these risks, by eliminating conflicting or duplicating procedures and objectives.
When it comes to assessing compliance with Part-ORO competent authorities should acknowledge that implementing effective safety risk management capabilities for all activities subject to the approval will take time and therefore a balanced approach for checking compliance is needed to enable a smooth transition towards the new management system requirements.
Considering the benefits of taking a holistic, integrated approach to management system for effective safety management, competent authorities should also not mandate the implementation of separate management systems for the different approvals of the same organisation. Competent authorities should instead focus on assessing whether the management system implemented is adequate as regards the size, nature and complexity of the activities it is deemed to cover.
2. Maintenance
The issue is slightly different in the area of contracted maintenance: As the Part-145 requirements have not yet been amended to align with the management system framework adopted for air operations, the maintenance organisation may not have established a management system to effectively identify maintenance specific hazards and manage related risks. However, the operator would still need to consider such hazards and risks entailed by contracted maintenance, as it would do for any other contracted activity that has an impact on aviation safety, under its own management system. Once Part-145 organisations will have implemented the new management system requirements including safety risk management, the operator will be able to establish an interface with the hazard identification and risk management processes of the maintenance organisation and consider the contracted organisation’s capability to properly address maintenance specific hazards and risks for their own safety risk management.
This FAQ addresses the case of  EU licensed air carriers, meaning operators holding both and AOC in accordance with Regulation (EU) No. 965/2013 and an operating licence in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008

                Is there a difference between safety risk management (SRM) and SMS?             



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations, ICAO Annex 19
ICAO defines SMS as “a systematic approach to managing safety, including the necessary organisational structures, accountabilities, policies and procedures.”
While SRM is an essential element within a management system for safety, it is not the only element required. To be effective, SRM needs a structured approach and an organisational framework with clearly defined policies, safety responsibilities and accountabilities. Such framework is essential to facilitate and encourage hazard identification, ensure a structured & consistent approach to risk assessment, as well as for allowing informed decisions to be made at the right organisational level, e.g. in relation to risk acceptability or different risk mitigation options. For example, the organisation needs to put in place policies, procedures and mechanisms for internal safety reporting and then maintain the conditions for allowing such reporting to take place.
Also, in order to ensure that the organisation is continually managing its risks it needs to monitor how well it performs, both in terms of effectiveness of risk controls implemented and effective compliance with applicable requirements. This is part of safety assurance, which is another component of an SMS as per ICAO Annex 19.
Additionally the organisation has to train their staff to fulfil their duties, including those related to any safety management task and to properly communicate on any safety relevant issue.
All this should lead to ensuring a systematic approach to SRM and help fostering the necessary ‘culture’ within the organisation to enable careful management and sound understanding of risk, including in day-to-day activities.
In conclusion, SRM, while being a core element of any management system for safety, should not be singled out as the only element required to implement such system.

                Why do the EASA Air Operations rules use the term ‘management system’ (ORO.GEN.200) and not ‘safety management system’ (SMS), like in ICAO Annex 19? Is there a difference between the two concepts?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations, Annex III (Part-ORO)
In the area of SMS the Agency promotes consolidated general requirements for an organisation’s management system. The starting point for drafting the ‘first extension’ rules are the essential requirements attached in the annexes to the Basic Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2018/1139) and these refer to ‘management system’, cf.  the essential requirements for air operations (Annex V, point 8.1 (c)):
“(…) the aircraft operator must implement and maintain a management system to ensure compliance with the essential requirements set out in this Annex, manage safety risks and aim for continuous improvement of this system;” (…)
The underlying concept is that for managing safety it is essential to take a holistic approach and to implement the new safety risk management (SRM) related processes while making use of and integrating these into the already existing management system (e.g. quality system as per JAR-OPS/ EU-OPS). For example, the internal audit process (compliance monitoring) is kept as an essential element of the management system, while ICAO Annex 19 is not that clear about it.
Hence, organisations should be encouraged to integrate the new SRM elements into their existing system and articulate these with the way the organisation is managed, addressing every facet of management, as any organisational change and any decision (even in areas such as Finance, Human Resources) will need to be assessed for their impact on safety. Such integrated approach to management is much more efficient for monitoring compliance, managing risks and maximising opportunities.
Finally, it is not required that organisations adapt their terminology to that used in Part-ORO: Should they wish to refer to SMS, QMS or SQMS etc., this is possible as long as they can demonstrate that all requirements are met. In the same vein, they can still use the title ‘quality manager’, although the rules refer to compliance monitoring manager.

                If an operator is considered complex , may a person hold the position as a Safety Manager and at the same time be one (or more) of the nominated persons as described in ORO.GEN.210(b), taken into account the size and complexity of the operator?            



 There is no guidance indicating that the safety manager may not be a nominated person in the organisational set up of a complex operator.
However, when assessing the organisational set-up of a complex operator, please consider also GM1 ORO.GEN.200(a)(1) point (b): “Regardless of the organisational set-up it is important that the safety manager remains the unique focal point as regards the development, administration and maintenance of the operator’s safety management system”.
In summary, the role of the safety manager is not addressed at the level of implementing rules. The acceptable means of compliance describe the functions of the safety manager in complex operators. The guidance material emphasises on the importance of having a unique focal point for the operator’s safety management system.
It is for the operator to determine if the combination of the safety manager function with that of a nominated person allows to fulfil the management functions of the nominated persons post associated with the scale and scope of the operation. It is then for the competent authority  to assess if such organisational set-up corresponds to the size of the operator and the nature and complexity of its activities, taking into account the hazards and associated risks inherent in these activities.
For the assessment of the appropriateness of the organisational set-up, the competent authority should also be satisfied that the operator complies with ORO.GEN.210(c) “The operator shall have sufficient qualified personnel for the planned tasks and activities to be performed in accordance with the applicable requirements.”

                I am looking for the acceptance of post holders, particularly the Safety manager. In the AMC we agreed on the functions of the Safety manager, but did we agree on his or her acceptance?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations, Annex II (Part ARO, ARO.GEN.310, ARO.GEN.330), Annex III (Part ORO, ORO.GEN.130)
Part ORO does not mention anymore the notion of acceptance/acceptability of nominated persons. This is now replaced by the notion of changes requiring prior approval or changes not requiring prior approval.
During the initial certification process, nominations of personnel in general are considered to be part of the verification of compliance performed by the competent authority and therefore covered by the issuance of the AOC.
Regarding changes to certified organisation, the notion of changes requiring prior approval/changes not requiring prior approval applies and therefore, a formal approval of certain change is required. Guidance is provided through GM1 ORO.GEN.130(a) and GM3 ORO.GEN.130(c). Likewise, upon initial certification, the competent authority may agree with the organisation on a more specific scope of changes that do not require prior approval, on the basis of ARO.GEN.310(c), and within the limits of the applicable requirements. Items not required to get a prior approval are managed by the organisation based on a procedure approved by the competent authority for the management of such changes. In any case, these changes have to be notified to the competent authority which will verify compliance with the applicable requirements (cf. ORO.GEN.130(c) and ARO.GEN.330(c)).
Regarding the specific case of the safety manager, it should be noted that there is no requirement for a safety manager at an implementing rule level. The nomination of a safety manager is one means to comply with the IR objective. Therefore, a change in safety manager is not listed in the GMs to ORO.GEN.130: A change in safety manager is not considered a change requiring a prior approval from the competent authority, unless, the accountable manager fulfils the role of safety manager, in which case a change would obviously require prior approval.
The above references are those to Regulation (EU) No 965/2012; the same provisions are included in Regulation (EU) No 290/2012 (ARA/ORA).

                Regarding ORO.GEN.200, could a commercial operator of complex motor powered aircraft, such as the Cessna Citation Bravo that operates within Europe and with no SPAs, be considered non-complex?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations, Annex III (Part ORO)
As defined in AMC1 ORO.GEN.200(b) the criterion in terms of full-time equivalents (FTEs) is the first one to be checked. This relates not only to the required organisational capability to implement and maintain a management system in line with Part ORO, but also to the fact that the larger the organisation gets, the more complex its procedures, communication and feedback channels will be, hence the need for robust processes related to hazard identification, safety risk management, performance measurement etc. For an organisation up to 20 FTEs, it is important to assess the 'risk profile' of the organisation in relation to the way it operates and this may justify the need for robust management processes for safety. The AMC defines the most relevant ones. The extent of contracting, the number, complexity and diversity of aircraft operated and type of operations (CAT, commercial, local, standard routes, hostile environment etc.) are all to be considered. It is important to note that the complexity criteria are included in an AMC to Part ORO and this makes a strong point as to the responsibility of the operator to make the assessment and justify the option chosen (complex or non-complex management system) to the satisfaction of the competent authority. If the option is to implement the provisions applicable to complex organisations, having details of management system implementation included in the form of AMCs to ORO.GEN.200, the operator may apply for an alternative means of compliance should it consider any of the elements of these AMCs inadequate for its specific type of organisation and operations.

                How should an operator use external material in relation with its operations manual (OM)?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations, Annex III (Part ORO)
AMC1 ORO.MLR.100 states that when the operator chooses to use material from other sources, either this material is copied or the OM should contain a reference to the appropriate section of this material.
In any case, this material from another source is considered to be part of the OM and therefore should meet all the general requirements applicable to the OM. It includes:
(c) of ORO.MLR.100, which states that the OM shall be kept up-to-date;
(d) of ORO.MLR.100, which states that the personnel shall have easy access to the portions of the OM relevant for their duties;
(c)(3) of AMC1 ORO.MLR.100, which states that the content and amendment status of the manual is controlled and clearly indicated;
(d)(3) of AMC1 ORO.MLR.100, which states that the OM should include a description of the amendment process which specifies the method by which the personnel are advised of the changes.
Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 does not define any specific way to achieve this; therefore it is left to the operator to identify the best way to achieve these objectives. It is then the responsibility of the operator’s competent authority during the initial certification process/evaluation of change process to determine if the solution chosen by the operator allows meeting these requirements.

                Status of the EASA FAQ: What is the legal status of the EASA FAQ?  My own understanding of this document is that it has no legal standing at all, insofar as it is neither an Implementing Rule (IR), Acceptable Means of Compliance (AMC), Alternative Means of Compliance (AltMoc) nor even Guidance Material (GM).            



 EASA is not the competent authority to interpret EU Law. The responsibility to interpret EU Law rests with the judicial system, and ultimately with the European Court of Justice. Therefore any information included in these FAQs shall be considered as EASA's understanding on a specific matter, and cannot be considered in any way as legally binding.
The answers provided represent EASA’s technical opinion and also indicate the manner how EASA is evaluating, as part of its standardisation continuous monitoring activities, the application by national competent authorities of the respective regulatory provisions.
In the margins of its future rulemaking activities, EASA will consider the opportunity to include some of these FAQ in Subpart FTL as GM.

                Applicability of FTL requirements of Regulation (EU) No 965/2012: Why should we comply with the FTL requirements of Regulation (EU) No 965/2012, since we have a policy in our company that says otherwise?             



 Regulation (EU) No 965/2012, including Subpart FTL, is mandatory in all Member States (MS).
This means that an operator cannot maintain a ‘policy’ it has had before the date of application of Subpart FTL of Regulation (EU) No 965/2012, unless the policy has been found compliant with that Regulation.
The competent authority of the operator is responsible for checking for compliance and for taking enforcement measure when a non-compliance is found.

                Applicability of Regulation (EU) No 965/2012: What is the meaning of "applicable national flight time limitation legislation" in Article 8 (4) of Regulation 965/2012?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 as amended by Regulation (EU) No 83/2014Topic: Applicability of Regulation (EU) No 965/2012
Article 8(4) of Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 stipulates that specialised operators continue to comply with applicable national flight time limitation legislation until EU implementing rules are adopted and apply.
 ‘Applicable national flight time limitation legislation’ is understood to mean the national law of the Member State in which the operator has its principal place of business, or, where the operator has no principal place of business, the place where the operator is established or resides.

                Collective Labour Agreements (CLA) - Regulation (EU) No 83/2014: Our company has a Collective Labour Agreement (CLA) and an approved IFTSS. Both contain rules about FPD’s, DP’s and rostering. Which one is leading?            



 Recital (4) of Regulation (EU) No 83/2014 stipulates that: ‘The provisions of this Regulation do not preclude and should be without prejudice to more protective national social legislation and CLA concerning working conditions and health and safety at work.’
This means that more protective measures concerning FDP, DP and rostering, agreed under a CLA, are ‘leading’.

                Applicability of Subpart FTL (see also ORO.AOC.125): Does Subpart FTL apply in relation to non-revenue flights (ferry flights)?            



 Any flight conducted by an AOC holder falls under Subpart FTL with the exception of:
some non-revenue flights such as: non-commercial, test, training, delivery, ferry and demonstration flights;
air taxi, single pilot and emergency medical services operations by aeroplane; and
CAT operations by helicopter, including HEMS.
However, aircraft positioning conducted by an AOC holder, immediately before or after a CAT sector counts as FDP and sector.

                Acclimatisation ORO.FTL.105(1): How should we determine the state of crew member acclimatisation in complex rotations?            



 Acclimatised crew members
A crew member is considered to be acclimatised to the time zone of the reference time for the first 48 hours.
In the following example there are 4 departure places: A, B, C and D and the crew member is in a known state of acclimatisation all the time. 
between A and B there is a 2-hour time difference 
between A and C – a  4 hour-time difference
between A and D – a  6-hour time difference
Day 1:  The crew member starts acclimatised at A and finishes at B. The reference time is the local time at A, because the crew member is acclimatised at A and reports at A. The time difference between A and B is 2 hours. That means that after resting at B, the crew will be considered acclimatised at B.
Day 2:  The crew member reports at B acclimatised to the local time at B for an FDP to C. At C the crew member has a rest period and becomes acclimatised to C. He/she has now covered 4-hour time difference, but in 2 days. 
Day 3: The crew member reports at C acclimatised to the local time at C for an FDP to D. At D the crew member has a rest period and becomes acclimatised to D. He/she has now covered 6-hour time difference.
Day 4:  The crew member reports again considered to be acclimatised at D. The local time at D is the reference time. The FDP between D and A covers 6-hour time difference. Crossing 6-hour time difference in one day (one FDP) induces time zone de-synchronisation. If the rotation finishes at A, the rest requirements in CS FTL.1.235 (b)(3)(i) are applicable.
Unknown state of acclimatisation 
After the first 48 hours of the rotation have elapsed, the crew member is considered to be in an unknown state of acclimatisation. 
The crew member only becomes acclimatised to the destination time zone, if he/she remains in that destination time zone for the time established in the table in ORO.FTL.105 (1). 
During that time the crew member may have the rest in accordance with CS FTL.1.235(b)(3) and/or take other duties that end in different time zones than the first arrival destination, until he/she becomes acclimatised in accordance with the values in the table in ORO.FTL.105(1). In the case of duties to different time zones, the state of acclimatisation should be determined in accordance with GM1 ORO.FTL.105(1) (d)(3).
Where the rotation  continues with duties to/from subsequent destinations, the greatest time difference from the reference time should be used for the purpose of rest in accordance with CS FTL.1.235(b)(3)(i). 
Time elapsed since reporting (h) in the tables ORO.FTL.105 (1) and CS FTL.1.235 (b)(3)(i) is the time that runs from first reporting at home base to the reporting at destination and includes the FDP from home base to destination plus layover time.

                Disruptive schedule ORO.FTL.105(8): Which criteria should be applied to determine a duty as disruptive if there is a time zone difference between the reporting point and the place where the duty finishes?            



 The criteria to be applied is the reference time e.g. the local time (LT) where the crew member reported for duty.
Example with “Late type” of Disruptive schedule:
LT in A = LT in B + 1 hour.
Day 1: The crew member starts the FDP acclimatised to A. He/she reports at 15:00 (LT-A) and finishes FDP in B at 23:30 (LT-B). It is a ‘Late finish’ because he/she is acclimatised to A, and FDP finishes at 00:30 (LT-A).
	Rest in B. After resting in B, which is within two hours’ time difference from A, the crew member gets acclimatised to B.
Day 2: The crew member reports in B at 15:00 (LT-B) and finishes FDP in A at 00:30 (LT-A). It is not a late finish, because he/she is acclimatised to B, and the FDP finishes at 23:30 (LT-B).

                Single day free of duty ORO FTL 105 (23): A ‘single day free of duty’ consists of one day and two local nights. Does the last day of several consecutive days free of duty need to contain at least one day and two nights?            



 Whenever one of the local days prescribed by Clause 9, Directive No 2000/79/EC, is assigned as a single day, it must contain two local nights. Whenever consecutive local days are assigned, the last day may not contain a local night. However, from a fatigue management perspective, planning the last day to end at midnight, reduces the restorative effect of that last day to a minimum. Rising before midnight to report at 00:01 on the last day could generate sleep debt.
The term ‘single day free of duty’ has been included in Regulation No 965/2012 in order to enable the implementation of Directive No 2000/79/EC, in particular its Clause 9:
‘Clause 9Without prejudice to Clause 3, mobile staff in civil aviation shall be given days free of all duty and standby, which are notified in advance, as follows:(a) at least seven local days in each calendar month, which may include any rest periods required by law; and(b) at least 96 local days in each calendar year, which may include any rest periods required by law.’
Clause 9 above employs the term ‘local day’ i.e. a period of 24 hours finishing at 00:00 LT.  At the same time, a ‘single day free of duty’ is a period of one day, including two local nights, that may finish between 06:00 and 08:00 LT, depending on the local night start and end times.

                Sector ORO.FTL.105 (24), (see also ORO.FTL.205 (f)(6)): In an abnormal or emergency situation a take-off might not be executed meaning that a sector was not completed. Such situation is likely to increase flight crew workload and fatigue. How could this be mitigated?            



 In such cases, in order to mitigate the increased workload and fatigue, the commander has the possibility to exercise commander’s discretion and decide on reducing the maximum daily FDP or increasing the minimum rest period.
ORO.FTL.205 (f)(6) requires operators to implement a non-punitive process for the use of commander’s discretion.
Also, if as a result of such situation a flight crew member feels unfit dues to fatigue, he/she may discontinue his duties on the aircraft for the day.
Regulation (EU) No 376/2014 on the reporting, analysis and follow-up of occurrences in civil aviation, requires the ability for crew members to report fatigue.

                Changes to a published roster: Is it possible to make changes to a published roster?            



 Yes, provided that the changes do not breach the limitations of the operator’s Individual Flight Time Specification Scheme (IFTSS).
All changes must be notified to the crew member before the pre-flight rest period commences so that the crew member is able to plan adequate rest as required by ORO.FTL.110 (a).
In support of this requirement the minimum period of time for notification of changes should be established by the operator and available in the Operations manual

                Change of FDP after reporting: Can a rostered FDP be changed (re-planned) after crew members have reported?            



 Yes, provided that the changed FDP allows a crew member to remain sufficiently free from fatigue in order to operate at a satisfactory level of safety comparable to the one that would have been attained by the originally rostered FDP.
This means that for operators who do not implement a predictive fatigue hazard identification the re-planning can be done within the rostered daily FDP which commenced at the time the crew members reported for the original duty, taking into account the actual number of sectors and crew configuration. Operators who implement predictive fatigue hazard identification should use those tools for the re-planning taking into account the FDP duration, number of sectors and crew configuration, cumulatively.
An operator is expected to roster ‘buffer periods’ or use standby crew or otherwise anticipate operational disruptions on the day of operation. In some situations there may be no other way than to re-plan a rostered duty period. In any case however, the operator should establish their own procedure for managing on-the-day disruptions, including re-planning of rostered duties, in the OM-A. 
Roster changes should be monitored by the operator through appropriate performance indicators for roster robustness (see also FAQ #16). The indicators’ values over a scheduled seasonal period need to be available to the aircrew and the competent authority.
Situations referred to above do not fall under ORO.FTL.205 (f) – (commander discretion) or (g) (delayed reporting). Commander discretion may still be applied to a changed duty, should the conditions prescribed by ORO.FTL.205 (f) apply.

                Roster publication, (see also  AMC1 ORO.FTL.110(a) and ORO.GEN.120): Are airline operators allowed to publish monthly rosters in less than 14 days in advance?            



 According to AMC1 ORO.FTL.110 (a), rosters should be published 14 days in advance. 
This requirement is an acceptable means of compliance (AMC). The AMC is one example of how operators could demonstrate compliance with this rule. 
	In accordance with ORO.GEN.120, an operator may use an alternative means of compliance.
It is therefore possible to use an alternative means of compliance (AltMoc) for the publication of rosters, provided the operator has demonstrated that the requirements of ORO.FTL.110 (a) are met. 
An alternative means of compliance requires prior approval from the competent authority. 
The competent authority must notify all approved alternative means of compliance to EASA.

 No. The pre-flight reporting time for all non-augmented flight crew members reporting for the same FDP is the same.
The minimum reporting times, which have been defined by the operator in the Operations manual for different types of aircraft, operations and airport conditions, shall always apply to all flight crew.
Reporting time for the same FDP may be different between flight crew and cabin crew in accordance with ORO.FTL.205(c).

                Operational robustness ORO.FTL.110(j): How should operational robustness be assessed?            



 The operator is required to have measures in place to protect the integrity of schedules and of individual duty patterns. 

	The operator must monitor for exceedances to the planned flight duty periods and if the planned flight duty periods in a schedule are being exceeded more than 33% during a scheduled seasonal period, change a schedule and/or crew arrangements.

	Operational robustness should be measured through performance indicators to determine if the planning is realistic and the rosters are stable.

	The operator may measure the cases where a rostered crew pairing for a duty period is achieved within the planned duration of that duty period.

	Performance indicators may also be established to measure the following:
difference between planned and actual flight hours;
difference between planned and actual duty hours;
difference between planned and actual number of days off;
number of unscheduled overnights; 
number of roster changes per scheduled seasonal period;
use of commander’s discretion;
changes of schedule carried out after published roster  
With regard to operator’s responsibilities, in particular operational robustness of rosters, we also recommend guidance material to ORO.FTL.110 developed by UK CAA.

                Flying activities outside an AOC  (see also ORO.FC.100): How will activities as an instructor or an examiner performed by an operating crew member in their free time be considered for the purpose of duty time and rest periods?            



 The purpose of Subpart-FTL is to ensure that crew members in commercial air transport operations are able to operate with an adequate level of alertness. It does not regulate the activities performed by crew members in their free time.
Nonetheless, it is the responsibility of crew members to make optimal use of the rest periods and to be properly rested so they will not perform duties when unfit due to fatigue.
A crew member in commercial air transport operations may be required to report to the operator his/her professional flying activities outside the commercial air transport operation to allow the operator to discharge its responsibilities (ORO.FTL.110) appropriately.
An operator should establish its policy with regard to crew members conducting these kinds of activities.

                Deviation from the applicable CS ORO.FTL.125 (c)  (see also ARO.OPS.235): What does a deviation from the applicable CS mean or derogation from an implementing rule?            



 The flight time specification schemes of an individual operator (IFTSS) may differ from the applicable CS / IRs under strict conditions.
The operator has a number of steps to follow before implementing a deviation/derogation.
Additionally, the competent authority has a number of steps to follow before approving a deviating/derogating IFTSS.
All the steps are described in this Evaluation Form (link) developed by EASA to facilitate NAAs and operators in this process.

                Flight time specification scheme for air taxi operations, (see also Articles 2 (6) and 8(2) of Regulation (EU) no 965/2012): An air taxi operator has both an aeroplane with less than 19 seats and one aeroplane with more than 20 seats. What FTL regulation shall the crew who is flying both types follow?            



 The operator implements Subpart ORO.FTL for its operations with aeroplanes of 20 seats or more. 
For air taxi operations with aeroplanes of 19 seats or less, the operator complies with EU OPS, Subpart Q.
However, the aim of the requirements is to ensure that crew members are able to operate at a satisfactory level of alertness. Fatigue accrued during an operation in one fleet might impact on the performance of a crew member when conducting a following flight in the other fleet. 
Therefore, from a fatigue management perspective, it makes sense to apply a common FTL scheme under Subpart ORO.FTL consistently to pilots in such operations.

 Published duty rosters may or may not include extended FDPs.
However, FDPs extended in accordance with ORO.FTL.205 (d) must be planned and notified to crew members in advance i.e. allowing each crew member to plan adequate rest.
The time limit for notification of a planned extended FDP to an individual crew member need to be established by the operator in line with ORO.FTL.110 and specified in the OM-A.

                Planned FDP extensions ORO.FTL.205(d)  (see also ORO.FTL.105(1)): Can a crew member acclimatised to the local time of the departure time zone (‘B’ state), but not acclimatised to the local time where he/she starts the next duty (‘D’ state), be assigned a planned extended flight?            



 While it may be legal to roster an extended FDP (no in-flight rest) to a crew member who is not acclimatised to the local time where the actual duty starts, the actual operational environment may be such that it would be very fatiguing for a particular crew member to perform that FDP.
Although operations on an extended FDP are possible under ORO FTL.1.205(d), the operator still needs to comply with the fatigue management obligations stemming from ORO.FTL.110 and especially to ensure that the crew members are sufficiently rested to operate.

                Commander’s discretion ORO.FTL.205(f): When should commander’s discretion be used?            



 Commander’s discretion may be used to modify the limits on the maximum daily FDP (basic or with extension due to in-flight rest), duty and rest periods in the case of unforeseen circumstances in flight operations beyond the operator’s control, which start at or after the reporting time.
Considering the ICAO definition of ‘unexpected conditions’, unforeseen circumstances in flight operations for the purpose of ORO.FTL.205(f) are events that could not reasonably have been predicted and accommodated, such as adverse  weather, equipment malfunction or air traffic delay, which may result in necessary on-the-day operational adjustments.
Commanders cannot be expected to exercise discretion without an understanding of the events that constitute unforeseen circumstances. It is therefore necessary that they receive appropriate training on the use of commander’s discretion along with how to recognize the symptoms of fatigue and to evaluate the risks associated with their own mental and physical state and that of the whole crew.
	Operators should ensure that sufficient margins are included in schedule design so that commanders are not expected to exercise discretion as a matter of routine

How would commander’s discretion apply when the FDP of a non-augmented crew has already been extended in accordance with ORO.FTL.205 (d))?            



 1. Up to 2 hours for two pilot crew and up to 3 hours for augmented crew.
2. For a two pilot extended FDP operation, the use of commander’s discretion is always based on the maximum daily FDP table ORO.FTL.205 (b) (1).
For example, when 1 hour has already been added to the maximum daily FDP in accordance with ORO.FTL.205 (d), then only 1 hour is left for commander’s discretion.

                Conversion/line checks  Post flight duty ORO.FTL.210: How should briefings and debriefings during conversion/line checks be accounted for?            



 In accordance with the definition of duty, conversion/line training is duty.
Any duty (including the briefing and debriefing for training purposes) after reporting for a duty that includes a sector or a series of sectors until the aircraft finally comes to rest and the engines are shut down, at the end of the last sector on which the crew member acts as an operating crew member, is considered flight duty period.
Post flight duties, on the other hand (including debriefings also for training purposes), are considered as duty period.

 The operator needs to implement a monitoring system to ensure that the minimum time period for post-flight duties is adequate since rest or shortened rest could potentially impact fatigue.
The commander or a cabin crew member should inform the operator where the post-flight duties have taken longer than planned and this is then accounted for in duty and rest periods.

 The time spent to travel from a place of rest or home base to a simulator, at the request of the operator, counts as a duty period.
Any transfer of a non-operating crew member from one place to the other at the request of the operator is called positioning and is counted as a duty period.
Travel from a crew member’s private place of rest to the reporting point at home base and vice versa, and local transfers from a place of rest to the commencement of duty and vice versa are travelling, but not positioning, and so not counted as duty period.

                Positioning  ORO.FTL.215: Does positioning begin when the crew member arrives at the airport/train station or when the aeroplane/train leaves?            



 Positioning begins after reporting at the designated reporting point.
The operator should publish reporting times taking into account the time necessary for completing the travelling procedures depending on the mode of transportation (e.g. registration of passengers and baggage, security checks, etc.).
First example: Crewmember 1 is required to position from A to B on the commercial flight of an airline other than the airline which Crewmember 1 is flying for. This commercial flight is departing at 10:00, but airport A is an international airport and the time necessary for passenger and baggage registration and security checks is 2h before departure time. In this case, the positioning begins 2h before departure time.  
Second example: Crewmember 2 is required to position from A to B on a high speed train. This train is departing at 10:00 and the time necessary for passenger and baggage registration and security checks is 15 minutes before departure time. In this case, the positioning begins 15min before departure time.

                Rest prior to a duty other than FDP ORO.FTL.235 (a): What is the duration of the rest period prior to a duty without FDP?            



 The term ‘minimum rest period’ under the Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 is only used for the recovery period before an FDP.
Otherwise, it is an off-duty period. The Regulation does not contain requirements for off-duty periods prior to a duty without FDP.
Example: FDP1 – off duty – DP1 – off duty – DP2 – rest – FDP2.
Nevertheless, the operator needs to be able to demonstrate they have considered the fatiguing nature and cumulative effects of these duty periods under their operator responsibilities as they can generate fatigue that could affect crew member’s ability to rest prior to his/her next FDP.
Also, the national law of the Member State regarding working time (as required by Council Directive 2000/79/EC) would be applicable and should be reviewed as it may contain minimum rest periods for crew members based in that Member State.

As a result, the crew member would exceed the 168 hours by 1 hour.            



 No. Extension of the 168 hours between two recurrent extended recovery rest periods is not allowed. 
The operator must better plan duties and rest times. The Regulation does not say that exactly 168 h must be reached; they are not a target, they are a maximum threshold.

                Record keeping ORO.FTL.245: Do records required in ORO.FTL.245 have to reflect planned or actual FDP, DP and rest?            



 Planned rosters may differ substantially from achieved rosters. 
In order to ensure appropriate oversight of FTL by the competent authority, operators need to maintain (for a period of 24 months) records of the actual values of flight times, FDP, rest periods and days free of all duties. 
According to AMC1 ORO.FTL.110 (j) on operational robustness operators should establish and monitor performance indicators for operational robustness rosters. 
This can only be done if operators keep records of both, planned and achieved rosters.

                In-flight rest  CS FTL.1.205(c) : Is it possible to extend the FDP, if not all pilots get an in-flight rest?            



 CS FTL.1.205(c)(1)(ii) specifies that, for the purpose of FDP extension, each crew member needs to have an in-flight rest period.
First example where an extension of the FDP due to in-flight rest is possible: 
Pilot 1 and Pilot 2 commence a FDP from A to B (1:30 h sector). When arriving at B, a third pilot (Pilot 3) joins the crew and they fly from B to C (11 h sector). 
The length of the flight from B to C allows each crew member on board (pilots 1, 2 & 3) to have the minimum in-flight rest period during cruise phase: 2 consecutive hours for the flight crew members at control during landing and consecutive 90-minute period for the third pilot. 
Second example, where an extension of the FDP due to in-flight rest is not possible: 
Pilot 1 and Pilot 2 commence a FDP from A to B (7 h sector). When arriving at B, a third pilot (Pilot 3) joins the crew and they fly from B to C (5 h sector).
	 
	The length of the flight from B to C does not allow each crew member on board (pilots 1, 2 & 3) to have the minimum in-flight rest period during cruise phase: 2 consecutive hours for the flight crew members at control during landing and consecutive 90-minute period for the third pilot.

                Maximum daily FDP with the use of extensions due to in flight rest CS FTL.1.205(c)(2): Why does the ‘maximum daily FDP with the use of extensions due to in flight rest’ not take into account the start of FDP at reference time?            



 An extended duty period will usually involve operating during the WOCL. The in-flight rest opportunity during the WOCL mitigates the absence of reduction of the FDP based on the reference time. 
The limits of CS FTL.1.205(c) (2) are therefore irrespective of the WOCL of crew members, on the condition that the minimum flight crew is augmented and in-flight rest facilities, meeting certain standards, are available to provide recuperative sleep

                Delayed reporting  CS FTL.1.205(d)(1): Is it possible to inform crew members of a delay without giving the new reporting time?            



 No. An actual reporting time must be given when the crew member is informed that the delayed reporting procedure is activated.
If an operator does not have a delayed reporting procedure, then it can’t be used.

                Delayed reporting  CS FTL.1.205(d)(1)(iii): Why does delayed reporting with a delay of less than 4 hours not account for the WOCL?  Is there any scientific evidence for this?            



 There is no scientific evidence, on the basis of which a delay of less than 4 hours does not take the WOCL into account.
 
In any case, operator’s procedures on delayed reporting should avoid or minimise the negative effect of WOCL encroachment.
 
Importantly, the maximum FDP will never become longer due to a delayed reporting time:
 
If the delay is less than 4 hours – the maximum FDP as originally planned, remains the same. 
If the delay is more than 4 hours – the maximum FDP will be shorter than the originally planned FDP, because the delayed reporting time has a limiting effect on it.
Procedures for delayed reporting must be described in the OM, including a notification time that allows the crew member to continue his/her rest when the delayed reporting procedure is activated. 
 
A delayed reporting procedure may be triggered by the operator, while the crew member is still at home or in the suitable accommodation facility, when prior to the beginning of a flight duty period an unforeseen event occurs which will delay the planned flight departure.

 Yes, but any extension of the FDPs limits in Table 3 of ORO.FTL.205 (b)(2) falls under the requirement for a FRM.

 CS FTL.1.220 (b) instructs the operator to specify actual times for post and pre-flight duties and for travelling in its operations manual. The minimum for the total is 30 minutes. 
The operator must demonstrate how travelling in both directions, and post and pre-flight duties are accomplished in the time defined in the OM.

                Rest after airport standby or other-standby CS FTL.1.225 (a)(1)& CS FTL.1.225 (b)(4): What is the basis for rest calculation after a standby followed by an FDP? Is it the reporting time for standby or the “actual reporting time” for the assigned FDP?            



 The minimum rest period depends on the length of previous duty. 
Airport standby counts as duty for the purpose of ORO.FTL.235. Therefore the rest calculation after airport standby followed by an FDP is based on the reporting time for that standby. This also applies to airport duty.
Other standby does not count as duty for the purpose of rest (it counts partly as duty for the purpose of ORO.FTL.210 only). Therefore the rest calculation after other-standby followed by an FDP is based on the reporting time for the assigned FDP

Does that mean that there is no limit for that kind of situation?            



 Yes, there is no limit. 
	The limit of 16 hours only applies to basic maximum daily FDPs without in-flight rest under ORO.FTL.205 (b) and to extended daily FDPs without in-flight rest under ORO.FTL.205 (d).
Furthermore, the operator applies appropriate fatigue risk management to actively manage the fatiguing effect of night duties of more than 10 hours in relation to the surrounding duties and rest periods

 According to CS FTL.1.225 (b)(2), the operator designs its standby procedures in a certain way. The expectation is on the design of the procedure by the operator, not on the individual crew member. 
The expectation on the crew member is to follow the procedure to the best of his/her abilities and in good faith at all times.

                Awake time CS FTL 1 225 (b)(2): Who is responsible for making sure that the 18h are not exceeded? The crew member or the operator? Can the operator fully transfer the responsibility to the crew member?            



 The operator is only required to have established such procedures (control mechanisms) so as to prevent situations where the combination of standby and FDP would lead to more than 18 hours awake time.
18 hours awake time is mentioned in the context of the combination of other-standby prior to an FDP and the FDP itself. A simple mathematical equation between the sum of the standby time and FDP, on the one hand, and the time awake on the other, is not possible to do, because the start time of the awake period is an unknown value i.e. the operator may be unable to verify how long a crew member has been awake. 
It is reasonable for the operator to expect crew members to manage their rest and sleep opportunities during pre-duty rest periods and while on standby in order to be able to perform FDP.
The procedure and expectation for the crew to rest appropriately during their standby should also be included when training crew on FTL and fatigue management.
	The following are examples of what an operator should consider when designing procedures:
the duties and rest periods prior to the scheduled standby;
the time of the day in which the rest period prior to the scheduled standby occurs; 
a minimum of 8 hours’ sleep opportunity before or within the scheduled standby, during which the crew member is not disturbed;
the length of the standby and the subsequent FDP;
the time for post flight duties and for travelling to the suitable accommodation if away from home base;
provision of training and advice to crew members
The NAAs are responsible for verifying that the above procedures have been established and are effective.

                Other-standby   CS FTL.1.225(b)(2), (see also CAT.OP.MPA.210(a)(3)): Would using a controlled rest procedure while the flight crew member is at his/her assigned station break the 18-hour awake time?            



 No. Controlled rest procedure is a countermeasure to manage unexpected fatigue, whilst the 18-hour awake time target is part of the operator roster planning procedures. 
According to CAT.OP.MPA.210 (a)(3) controlled rest organised by the commander, if workload permits, shall not be considered to be part of a rest period for purposes of calculating flight time limitations nor used to justify any extension of the duty period.
Under CS FTL.1.225 (b)(2), the operator designs standby procedures in a way that makes unexpected fatigue unlikely by avoiding excessive awake times. 
The frequent use of controlled rest after having been called from other-standby could indicate that the standby procedure does not fulfil the expectation to avoid excessive awake times. 
Controlled rest procedure to manage unexpected fatigue should be described in the operations manual. (ref. AMC3 ORO.MLR.100).
The operator should be able to monitor the use of controlled rest to evaluate effectiveness of mitigation strategies.

                Other-standby CS FTL.1.225 (b), (see also ORO.FTL.105 (25)): Is it possible during other-standby to assign an FDP with a reporting time after the rostered end of that standby period has elapsed?            



 It is possible during other-standby to assign a duty that will start after the rostered end of the standby period.
Duties assigned during other-standby should in principle start within the operator’s defined response time from the call. For example, a cabin crew while on home standby between 08:00h and 14:00h (as planned in the roster) receives a call at 13:55 h to report for duty at 14:55 h since the operator’s response time is 60 min. The response time between the call and reporting is considered a continuation of the standby, notwithstanding the rostered end of the standby; this time also includes travelling to the reporting point.
Operators describe their procedures and practices regarding standby, including reporting after the rostered standby period ends, in the OM-A. In doing so, they take into account that the Regulation provides a number of cumulative protections to crew member from excessive periods of combined standby and duty:
Operators shall only use the rostered standby availability period to place their call for duty. ORO.FTL.105 (25) defines standby as the period of time during which a crew member is required by the operator to be available to receive an assignment for a flight;
The maximum duration of other-standby is 16 hours. In its OM-A however, the operator may specify shorter periods considering its type of operation and the impact of the time spent on standby on the duty that may be assigned. Under the obligations of ORO.FTL.110 (b & e), operators must carefully evaluate what duration of standby is safely allowable within their particular operation;
The combination of standby and FDP do not lead to more than 18 hours awake time (see FAQ # 60);
The maximum FDP is reduced, if the standby period ceases after the first 6 hours (or 8 hours in case of extended FDP);
A crew member is always able to consider whether his/her duties on board an aircraft will be performed with the necessary level of alertness (CAT.GEN.MPA.100(c))
If no duty has been assigned during the rostered standby availability period, other-standby is followed by a rest period in accordance with ORO.FTL.235.

                Other-standby modified to airport standby CS FTL.1.225, (see also ORO.FTL.105 (25)): Can other-standby be modified to airport standby during the standby?  For example, can a pilot on home standby be required to go to the airport to continue on airport standby? What limits must be used?            



 Yes. During a standby period any duty may be assigned (ORO.FTL.105 (25)). That includes airport standby or duty at the airport. 
Limits for assignment of airport standby after home standby are not explicitly mentioned in CS FTL.1.225. 
The assignment of airport standby is considered as airport duty and the subsequent FDP counts from the airport reporting time as stated in ORO.FTL.225 (d). 
If the other-standby lasts less than 6 hours, the maximum FDP counts from reporting for the airport standby. If the other-standby lasts more than 6 hours, a reduction is applicable to the subsequent FDP.
If an FDP is assigned during the airport standby, the combination of home standby and FDP does not lead to more than 18 hours awake time.

 Reserve times do not count as duty period for the purpose of ORO.FTL.210 and ORO.FTL.235. 
That means that there is no requirement for a minimum rest period after reserve, if no duty has been assigned.

                Rest between disruptive schedules  CS FTL.1.235(a)(1), (see also ORO.FTL.105(8)): The rule for transition between late finish/night duty and early start says that the rest between the FDPs needs to include a local night. Does this mean that the rule only applies if the late finish/night duty and the early duty are FDP’s?            



 It depends on the type of the early duty following a late or night duty.
If an early duty is a standby or a duty at the airport that leads to an FDP, then the rest period before that early duty must include a local night. 
Otherwise, the rest period between the 2 other duties or between a FDP and other duty (e.g. night training in a simulator) does not need to include 1 local night. 
Nevertheless, Subpart FTL provides a system of measures which jointly act to reduce the risk of increased fatigue and reduced alertness and performance levels of crew members, and to mitigate the acute disruption of the sleep pattern in the case of disruptive schedules.
For example, the operator must avoid practices that cause a serious disruption of an established sleep/work pattern, such as alternating day/night duties (ORO.FTL.110).

 For the purpose of CS FTL.1.235 (b) (4), ‘Eastward-Westward and Westward-Eastward transition’ means the transition at home base between a rotation in one direction and a rotation in the opposite direction, each involving a 4-hour time difference or more. 
At least 3 local nights of rest at home base are provided between such alternating rotations.
However, irrespective of where the transition occurs - at home base or away from home base, the operator, using safety risk management processes, should monitor rotations in opposite directions in terms of their impact on crew members’ circadian rhythm and fatigue, and provide sufficient rest to crew members between such rotations.

                Nutrition ORO.FTL.240: Are nutrition provisions subject to a specific NAA's approval and can they be documented elsewhere in the OM-A, not necessarily Chapter 7.            



 Nutrition is part of the operator’s individual flight time specification scheme (IFTSS) which is subject to approval by the competent authority under ARO.OPS.235 (a).
Chapter 7 of the OM-A is the place where the operator describes its IFTSS. Nutrition opportunities during duty periods are therefore to be included under that Chapter.
In cases where nutrition provisions are documented elsewhere in the OM-A, the operator should provide references in Chapter 7 to those nutrition provisions to enable aircrew to easily trace and read about the applicable nutrition arrangements. Irrespective of the place where nutrition opportunities are described in detail, they are part of the IFTSS and subject to NAA’s approval.
IFTSS is customised to the operator’s specific operating conditions e.g. routes and airports served, specific rest requirements and duty length. The later in turn impacts nutrition opportunities – timing, duration and other arrangements.
The content of the OM need be presented in a form that can be used without difficulty by cre members. The same applies to the operator’s IFTSS.

                Fatigue management training ORO.FTL.250 AMC1 ORO.FTL.250: What should be the minimum requirements for a fatigue management instructor? Is a CRMi course enough? Is a safety manager ready and without other training to deliver a course? Can someone that has received a few hours course in accordance with AMC1 ORO.FTL.250 repeat the course to others?             



 Although ORO.FTL does not contain prescriptive requirements determining the qualification of fatigue management instructors, those instructors are an operator’s personnel and hence, need to acquire at least the knowledge specified in AMC1 ORO.FTL.250.
Any operator needs to demonstrate to the competent authority that their personnel has acquired at least the knowledge as per the syllabus in AMC1 ORO.FTL.250.
In essence, the fatigue management training is a competency-based training. The operator should identify what training and competences are needed for each personnel group: aircrew, instructors, rostering and management staff to perform their roles effectively, and what means of measuring the level of competency attained by each person who receives the training is available.
For example, a fatigue management instructor must have the training required by AMC1 ORO.FTL.250. The operator may, in addition to that, require that the instructor also complete training normally required for FRM inspectors in accordance with AMC5 ARO.GEN 200(a) (2).
Recommended fatigue management training topics for specific groups of employees can be found in the ICAO Doc 9966 Manual for the Oversight of Fatigue Management Approaches/Second Edition 2016.
Operators who aim to establish a system for fatigue risk management (FRM), should consider including the following additional subjects, for aircrew, FSAG members, FRM instructors, FRM auditors, managers, according to their functions:
the science behind FRM;
requirements of Part-ORO with respect to FRM;
components of the FRM of that particular operator and its functioning;
FRM predictive, reactive and proactive processes
roster fatigue metrics
fatigue safety performance indicators

employees’ responsibilities with respect to the FRM;
use of fatigue reporting systems and implementing mitigations;
collection of fatigue data (both subjective and objective) to feed the FRM system.
The content and frequency of fatigue management training should be proportional to the operator’s fatigue risk exposure. For example, a scheduled airline and an on-demand night cargo operator are likely to establish different syllabus and frequency for their aircrew training.  Also, an airline with crew members commuting long hours to/from their home base, should particularly focus on the use of company’s airport or hotel crew rooms for fatigue mitigation of disruptive schedules when providing fatigue management training.

                Use of baby bassinets on board            



 Reference: Certification Specifications and Acceptable Means of Compliance for Large Aeroplanes CS-25 (ED Decision 2012/008/R) is available on EASA website.
Provision of a baby bassinet is a cabin service provided by an airline to a parent travelling with a baby for the purpose of relieving the parent from holding the lap-held baby for a long period of time, especially on long-haul and ultra-long-haul flights. 
Baby bassinets are included in the certification process of the aircraft in which they will be installed. They are not certified as separate devices, therefore an aircraft may not have a baby bassinet at all. The choice is up to the airline. The airline may choose to have a permanently installed ‘baby bed’ on its aircraft and its use during taxi, take-off, landing and turbulence will be described in the attached placards.
If baby bassinets are available on board, their number in the cabin depends on the cabin arrangement of the aircraft and locations where the bassinets can be safely attached/positioned. The number of baby bassinets at one location, usually at a bulkhead, depends on the available space, the weight the bulkhead can hold and the number of oxygen masks for the adults and babies located in that individual row.
Baby bassinet is not a child restraint device. Baby bassinets are not certified for taxi, take-off, landing and turbulent weather conditions. They may swing up and down and are not stable during turbulence, therefore the baby must be removed from the baby bassinet during turbulence and secured as instructed by your cabin crew members. 
Airlines carrying baby bassinets on board may have varying policies on their use, therefore it is necessary to check the airline’s website or get in contact with the airline. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) may also be able to provide more information. 
Certification placarding requirements
	Placards advising on the stowage of baby bassinets during taxi, take-off, landing and turbulence are required either at the location where baby bassinets will be fixed to the aircraft structure (e.g. bulkhead) or a clearly visible instruction advising on the same must be placed on the baby bassinet itself. 
The placarding requirements are related to the general certification requirements on placarding and intended function in accordance with Certifications Specifications and Acceptable Means of Compliance for Large Aeroplanes CS-25 (ED Decision 2012/008/R) and the marking requirements as specified in the approval of the equipment. For any questions on certification matters, please contact the EASA Certification directorate.

                    Use of Child Seats on Board                  




        
            
                Can I use a child seat on board for my baby/child? What about a rear-facing child seat?             



 EASA cares for the safe transport of babies and children by air and encourages the use of child seats on board an aircraft. EASA is actively working with the European Member States and with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Cabin Safety Group (ICSG) on finding a solution that would facilitate a global mutual recognition of child restraint devices for infants and children amongst States and airlines. 
Having a child seat on board an aircraft requires an assessment of several aspects, such as the aircraft seat itself, if the aircraft seat is forward-facing or rear-facing, how the child seat can be safely secured on the aircraft seat, the distance between seat rows where the child seat is intended to be placed, etc. Practically all child seats allowed on board are those that have been tested and certified for the use in cars. There may be limitations for their use in cars and there are also limitations for their use in an aircraft cabin. Depending on the specifics of the child seat, but also on the specifics of the aircraft seats and of the aircraft cabin arrangement, the operator decides which child seats are accepted on board its aircraft and which ones cannot be accepted due to safety reasons.
Rear-facing child seats are recommended for the use in cars for babies and children up until the age of 4. The use of a rear-facing (also referred to as ‘aft-facing’) child seat on board an aircraft may however be limited due to the distance between passenger seat rows (so-called ‘seat pitch’). Airlines are free to order from an aircraft manufacturer an aircraft with a cabin arrangement of their choice (including the distance between seat rows) provided it is compliant with the existing aircraft certification rules. Each cabin arrangement must be approved by EASA and must comply with the applicable safety standards including emergency evacuation. EU legislation however does not specify a prescriptive figure related to the minimum distance between seats (i.e. seat rows), aircraft designers comply with the standards using a range of biometrics.
It is the operator’s responsibility to establish procedures for its operation which are subject to the approval or acceptance by the National Aviation Authority of that EU Member State. Please, contact your airline for information on the use and types of child seats on board.
Extract from the EU rules on air operations related to the acceptance of child seats on board:
Commission Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on air operations, Annex IV – Part-CAT:
CAT.IDE.A.205 Seats, seat safety belts, restraint systems and child restraint devices
(a) Aeroplanes shall be equipped with:
(1) a seat or berth for each person on board who is aged 24 months or more;
(2) a seat belt on each passenger seat and restraining belts for each berth except as specified in (3);
(3) a seat belt with upper torso restraint system on each passenger seat and restraining belts on each berth in the case of aeroplanes with an MCTOM of less than 5700 kg and with an MOPSC of less than nine, having an individual CofA first issued on or after 8 April 2015;
(4) a child restraint device (CRD) for each person on board younger than 24 months;
 …….
AMC1 CAT.IDE.A.205 Seats, seat safety belts, restraint systems and child restraint devices
CHILD RESTRAINT DEVICES (CRDS)
(a) A CRD is considered to be acceptable if:
(1) it is a ‘supplementary loop belt’ manufactured with the same techniques and the same materials as the approved safety belts; or
(2) it complies with (b).
(b) Provided the CRD can be installed properly on the respective aircraft seat, the following CRDs are considered acceptable:
(1) CRDs approved for use in aircraft by the competent authority on the basis of a technical standard and marked accordingly;
(2) CRDs approved for use in motor vehicles according to the UN standard ECE R 44, -03 or later series of amendments;
(3) CRDs approved for use in motor vehicles and aircraft according to Canadian CMVSS 213/213.1;
(4) CRDs approved for use in motor vehicles and aircraft according to US FMVSS No 213 and manufactured to these standards on or after 26 February 1985. US approved CRDs manufactured after this date must bear the following labels in red letters:
(i) ‘THIS CHILD RESTRAINT SYSTEM CONFORMS TO ALL APPLICABLE FEDERAL MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY STANDARDS’; and
(ii) ‘THIS RESTRAINT IS CERTIFIED FOR USE IN MOTOR VEHICLES AND AIRCRAFT’;
(5) CRDs qualified for use in aircraft according to the German ‘Qualification Procedure for Child Restraint Systems for Use in Aircraft’ (TÜV Doc.: TÜV/958-01/2001); and
(6) devices approved for use in cars, manufactured and tested to standards equivalent to those listed above. The device should be marked with an associated qualification sign, which shows the name of the qualification organisation and a specific identification number, related to the associated qualification project. The qualifying organisation should be a competent and independent organisation that is acceptable to the competent authority.
(c) Location
(1) Forward-facing CRDs may be installed on both forward-and rearward-facing passenger seats, but only when fitted in the same direction as the passenger seat on which they are positioned. Rearward-facing CRDs should only be installed on forward-facing passenger seats. A CRD should not be installed within the radius of action of an airbag unless it is obvious that the airbag is de-activated or it can be demonstrated that there is no negative impact from the airbag.
(2) An infant in a CRD should be located as near to a floor level exit as feasible.
(3) An infant in a CRD should not hinder evacuation for any passenger.
(4) An infant in a CRD should neither be located in the row (where rows are existing) leading to an emergency exit nor located in a row immediately forward or aft of an emergency exit. A window passenger seat is the preferred location. An aisle passenger seat or a cross aisle passenger seat that forms part of the evacuation route to exits is not recommended. Other locations may be acceptable provided the access of neighbour passengers to the nearest aisle is not obstructed by the CRD.
(5) In general, only one CRD per row segment is recommended. More than one CRD per row segment is allowed if the infants are from the same family or travelling group provided the infants are accompanied by a responsible adult sitting next to them.
(6) A row segment is the fraction of a row separated by two aisles or by one aisle and the aeroplane fuselage.
(d) Installation
(1) CRDs should only be installed on a suitable aeroplane seat with the type of connecting device they are approved or qualified for. For instance, CRDs to be connected by a three point harness only (most rearward-facing baby CRDs currently available) should not be attached to an aeroplane seat with a lap belt only; a CRD designed to be attached to a vehicle seat only by means of rigid bar lower anchorages (ISO-FIX or US equivalent), should only be used on aeroplane seats that are equipped with such connecting devices and should not be attached by the aeroplane seat lap belt. The method of connecting should be the one shown in the manufacturer’s instructions provided with each CRD.
(2) All safety and installation instructions should be followed carefully by the responsible adult accompanying the infant. Cabin crew should prohibit the use of any inadequately installed CRD or not qualified seat
(3)  If a forward-facing CRD with a rigid backrest is to be fastened by a lap belt, the restraint device should be fastened when the backrest of the passenger seat on which it rests is in a reclined position. Thereafter, the backrest is to be positioned upright. This procedure ensures better tightening of the CRD on the aircraft seat if the aircraft seat is reclinable.
(4) The buckle of the adult safety belt must be easily accessible for both opening and closing, and must be in line with the seat belt halves (not canted) after tightening.
(5) Forward-facing restraint devices with an integral harness must not be installed such that the adult safety belt is secured over the infant.
(e) Operation
(1) Each CRD should remain secured to a passenger seat during all phases of flight unless it is properly stowed when not in use.
(2) Where a CRD is adjustable in recline, it must be in an upright position for all occasions when passenger restraint devices are required.
Extract from the ICAO guidance on the approval and use of child restraint systems (ICAO Document 10049):
2.4.3 The seat pitch or the available space between two rows of seats may also be an issue and particularly significant for aft-facing CRS as they are further reclined and take up more horizontal space. The inability to be effectively installed using existing aircraft seat belts may also render motor vehicle CRS ineffective on board. The location of anchor points can also be problematic. This includes the location of the aircraft seat belt attachment to the aircraft seat, as a CRS must translate forward until the belt path angle allows for belt tension forces to restrain the device.
Note: CRS means ‘child restraint system’.

                    Medical fitness                  




        
            
                Is Cabin Crew Member required to carry his/her medical certificate when on duty?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 Aircrew, Annex IV Part-MED and ED Decision 2011/015/R are available on EASA website. 
EU legislation does not contain any provisions on the carriage of a medical report when on duty. MED.C.030(a)(2) requires cabin crew members to provide the related information of their medical report or the copy of their medical report to the operator(s) employing their services. MED.C.030(b) requires the cabin crew medical report to indicate the date of the aero-medical assessment, whether the cabin crew member has been assessed fit or unfit, the date of the next aero-medical assessment and, if applicable, any limitation(s). Any other elements shall be subject to medical confidentiality in accordance with MED.A.015.
Cabin crew members are encouraged to carry their medical report or a copy while on duty to attest their medical fitness and limitation(s). The operator may also have procedures in place through which a cabin crew member’s medical report can be readily available upon request by a competent authority.

                Decrease of medical fitness and an ‘unfit’ medical report.            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 Aircrew, Annex IV Part-MED and ED Decision 2011/015/R are available on EASA website.
In case of a decrease in cabin crew member’s medical fitness, the cabin crew member shall, without undue delay, seek the advice of an aero-medical examiner or aero-medical centre or, where allowed by the Member State, an occupational health medical practitioner who will assess the medical fitness of the individual and decide if the cabin crew member is fit to resume his/her duties.
In case a cabin crew member has been assessed as ‘unfit’, the cabin crew member has the right of a secondary review. The cabin crew member shall not perform duties on an aircraft and shall not exercise the privileges of their cabin crew attestation until assessed as ‘fit’ again.

                    Language proficiency                   




        
            
                Is there any requirement on cabin crew member(s) communication with passengers in a certain language?             



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 Air Operations, Annex III (Part-ORO) and Annex IV (Part-CAT) is available on EASA website.

	There is no EU (or ICAO requirement) that cabin crew members must speak English. It is a general practice that cabin crew members do speak English to facilitate the communication in the aviation industry. The operator defines what languages its cabin crew members must be able to speak and at what level. 

	Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 specifies the following two requirements:
 
The operator shall ensure that all personnel are able to understand the language in which those parts of the Operations Manual, which pertain to their duties and responsibilities, are written (ORO.MLR.100(k)), and
The operator shall ensure that all crew members can communicate with each other in a common language (CAT.GEN.MPA.120).
		There is no EU (or ICAO) requirement for a specific language regarding cabin crew communication with passengers. It must be noted that it is difficult, if not impossible, to mandate the ‘required’ languages to be used on board with regard to communication with passengers, as this differs on daily basis from a flight to flight. For example, a German airline has a flight departing from Frankfurt to Madrid and it is assumed that the cabin crew members speak German since they work for a German operator. In addition, they may speak English if the operator selected this language as a criterion. The passenger profile may, however, be such that these languages are not ‘desired’ on this flight as passengers do not necessarily speak or understand any of the two languages (passengers may be e.g. Russian, Chinese, Iranian, Indian, Pakistani, Polish, Finnish, Croatian, Hungarian, Bulgarian, Czech, Slovak, etc., or there is a large group of e.g. Japanese tourists).
		Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 mandates the operator to ensure that briefings and demonstrations related to safety are provided to passengers in a form that facilitates the application of the procedures applicable in case of an emergency and that passengers are provided with a safety briefing card on which picture type-instructions indicate the operation of emergency equipment and exits likely to be used by passengers. It is therefore the operator’s responsibility to choose the languages to be used on its flights, which may vary depending on the destination or a known passenger profile. It is also a practice of some operators to employ ‘language speakers’, i.e. cabin crew members speaking certain languages, who mainly operate their language-desired route(s).

                Do cabin crew members have to be able to speak English to obtain their Cabin Crew Attestation?

                    Practical ‘raft’ training                   




        
            
                Why does Initial training under Part-CC require practical ‘raft’ training even if the operator’s aircraft is not equipped with slide rafts or life rafts?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 Aircrew as amended by Regulation (EU) No 290/2012 Part-CC available on EASA website.
Under EU-OPS, practical training on the use of rafts was required during Initial training. EU-OPS was a regulation directed, and applicable, to operators, therefore, an operator could provide raft training only when a cabin crew member was to actually  operate on the operator’s aeroplane fitted with rafts or similar equipment. The training was conducted with that operator’s specific equipment/rafts.
The Initial training under Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011, Part CC is no longer ‘operator-related’, it is generic, therefore, the practical training on rafts or similar equipment and an actual practice in water are not specific to an operator’s equipment. 
CCA holders, when recruited by an operator, are expected to have the ability to perform all types of cabin crew duties, including ditching related duties in water. Part-CC Cabin Crew Attestation (CCA) is issued for a life time and is recognised across all EU. Unlike the EU OPS Attestation, the CCA is subject to validity to attest the competence of the individual cabin crew member. This is foreseen in the Basic Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2018/1139) taking into account the increasing mobility of personnel in the aviation industry and the need to harmonise cabin crew qualifications.
An operator may be granted an approval to provide Part-CC Initial training and to issue the CCA (entitled to a mutual recognition as described above). That operator no longer acts as an operator training only its own cabin crew for its specific operations. That operator acts as a training organisation training future cabin crew who, in their life time, may also operate with other operators and in other Member States.

                    Aircraft type training                  




        
            
                Do I have to undergo Aircraft type specific training and operator conversion training with every new operator I join if I am already qualified on that aircraft type?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 Air Operations, Annex III (Part ORO) is available on EASA website.
Aircraft type specific training and operator conversion training is not transferable from one operator to another as each operator may have its own customised aircraft cabin configurations incl. differences in safety and emergency equipment and standard operating and emergency procedures. Therefore, as required by ORO.CC.125, cabin crew members must complete Aircraft type specific training and operator conversion training before being assigned to operate on the operator’s aircraft.

                Can a cabin crew training organisation (CCTO) provide Aircraft type specific training and operator conversion training?             



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 Air Operations, Annex III (Part ORO) is available on EASA website.
Aircraft type specific training and operator conversion training is a requirement directed to operators as specified in ORO.GEN.005, therefore the operator is responsible for this training. However, an operator may contract out some activities (e.g. training) as specified in ORO.GEN.205 complemented by AMC1 ORO.GEN.205 and GM1 ORO.GEN.205 and GM2 ORO.GEN.205. Therefore, CCTO can only provide Aircraft type specific training and operator conversion training if contracted by an operator to do so. The operator remains responsible for this training and for the competence of its cabin crew.

                    Reduction of cabin crew during ground operations                  




        
            
                Do the evacuation procedures with a reduced number of required cabin crew during ground operations or in unforeseen circumstances require prior endorsement?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 Air Operations and the associated ED Decisions are available on EASA website.
The minimum number of cabin crew for an aircraft type, as determined by certification and approved by EASA, is stated on the Type Certification Data Sheet. The minimum number of cabin crew and the evacuation procedures form part of the Operations Manual. Reducing the minimum cabin crew is a deviation from the required minimum number and requires close monitoring. Changes to evacuation procedures with a reduced number of cabin crew are required to be acceptable to the Competent Authority.
	The minimum number of cabin crew required in the passenger compartment may be reduced under conditions stated in ORO.CC.205 incl. AMC1 ORO.CC.205 (c)(1). Procedures must be established in the operations manual; it has to be ensured that an equivalent level of safety is achieved with the reduced number of cabin crew, in particular for evacuation of passengers.

                    Instructor and Examiner being the same person – conflict of interest                  




        
            
                Instructor who provided any topic of the Initial training should not act as Examiner to avoid conflict of interest. What about small operators / cabin crew training organisations employing only one ground Instructor, for example to cover dangerous goods or aero-medical aspects and first aid?             



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 Aircrew and ED Decision 2012/006/R are available on EASA website.
ED Decision 2012/006/R, AMC1 ARA.CC.200(b)(2) clarifies that in such cases, the operator/training organisation establishes procedures to avoid situations that could lead to a conflict of interest, e.g. where an Instructor has to check/evaluate the proficiency of the trainee he/she has trained.
The qualifications of Instructors/Trainers, as well as of Examiners, are not defined at EU level, and remain to be defined by each Member State. Therefore, only the Competent Authorities may assess, when approving the training and checking programmes of the operator/training organisation, if the procedures can ensure that the objective of the rule is met. 
 
AMC1 ARA.CC.200(b)(2) Approval of organisations to provide cabin crew training or to issue cabin crew attestations 
PERSONNEL CONDUCTING EXAMINATIONS
	For any element being examined for the issue of a cabin crew attestation as required in Part CC, the person who delivered the associated training or instruction should not also conduct the examination. However, if the organisation has appropriate procedures in place to avoid conflict of interest regarding the conduct of the examination and/or the results, this restriction need not apply.

                Determination of the minimum required number of cabin crew on an aircraft            



 NOTE: The purpose of this FAQ is to explain how the operator and the Competent Authority (National Aviation Authority) conclude the minimum number of cabin crew required on the operator’s aircraft. This FAQ does not provide specific numbers for aircraft types or individual aircraft. The minimum number of cabin crew may vary on each aircraft, depending on the certification history of that aircraft. To learn the minimum number of cabin crew on your aircraft, please, consult your Competent Authority. To have a better view and understanding of the explanation below, this FAQ should be read together with the rule ORO.CC.100 (Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 – ‘Air Operations’, Annex III (Part-ORO), Subpart-CC, paragraph ORO.CC.100).                                                                                                                                                                                                          
Minimum number of cabin crew is established during the certification process of each aircraft. As of 3rd July 2017, it is required that this number is clearly written in the certification documentation issued for each aircraft (reference: EASA Certification Memo CM-CS-008 Issue 01, issued in July 2017). Therefore, when developing standard operating procedures, the operator applies the number written in the certification documentation (this is required by the ‘Air Operations’ rule paragraph ORO.CC.100(b)(1)). However, historically, not all aircraft had this number written/defined in the certification documentation, and in this case, the operator uses a calculation method in accordance with the ‘Air Operations’ rule paragraph ORO.CC.100(b)(2). 
Therefore, the operator and the National Aviation Authority must refer to the certification documentation issued for the aircraft in question to see if the minimum number of cabin crew is written/defined in the certification documentation.
In summary:
	Airworthiness certification documentation of your aircraft issued:
Before 3rd July 2017: the operator may apply the calculation method in accordance with the rule ORO.CC.100(b)(2)) only in cases where the certification documentation does not include the minimum number of cabin crew. 
After 3rd July 2017: the operator must apply the number of cabin crew specified in the certification documentation in accordance with the rule ORO.CC.100(b)(1). 
Background: In accordance with Regulation (EU) No 965/2012, paragraph ORO.CC.100, when establishing the number of cabin crew needed for each aircraft and flight, the operator has to consider all operational aspects as required by ORO.CC.100(a) and the associated AMC1 ORO.CC.100. Paragraph ORO.CC.100(b) then provides the methods for determining the minimum number of cabin crew, i.e. by either applying the number established during the certification process or by a calculation of 1 cabin crew member per 50 installed passenger seats.  
	The development stage of Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 (AIR OPS) initially did not include the paragraph (b)(2), i.e. the ‘1 per 50’ calculation, in ORO.CC.100. This inclusion was done last minute in a way that resulted in the overall lack of clarity of ORO.CC.100(b), i.e. how to establish the minimum required number of cabin crew. This led to some implementation difficulties for operators when the new operational rules (AIR OPS) were introduced. To help with the implementation, EASA published SIB 2014-29, which provided detailed information on how to comply with ORO.CC.100. The SIB was supported by the EU Members States, however resulted in a strong opposition by EU operators. As a result, discussions were held in 2015 between EASA and IATA/IACA on the application of ORO.CC.100(b), i.e. how to establish the minimum required number of cabin crew. EASA acknowledged that the interpretation of ORO.CC.100(b) was unclear. As an outcome of these discussions, on 7th December 2015 EASA communicated to the stakeholders the ‘EASA conclusions following the consultation on the proposed Certification Memo and Safety Information Bulletin on minimum cabin crew for twin‐aisle aeroplanes’.    
On 3rd July 2017, EASA published the Certification Memo EASA-CM-CS-008 Issue 01. This document clarifies to aircraft manufacturers and design organisations that the number of cabin crew assumed in their evacuation certification activity must be clearly stated in their documentation. Following the publication of the EASA Certification Memo, the relevant Type Certification Data Sheets (TCDSs) have been amended and now include the minimum number of cabin crew already established by the aircraft manufacturers. In some cases the applicable minimum number of cabin crew for a particular aircraft may be different to that shown in the TCDS, for instance in case of specific cabin layouts if a lower number of cabin crew was approved by EASA.

                    Working for multiple operators                  




        
            
                I work for Operator A and have short/long-term contract(s) with Operator B. What training do I require when I return back to Operator A after the completion of my short/long-term contract with Operator B?            



 Ref.: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 Air Operations, Annex III (Part-ORO) is available on EASA website.
When joining Operator B, the cabin crew member undergoes the Aircraft type specific and operator conversion training & Familiarisation.
When returning to Operator A (after completing the short/long-term contract with Operator B) the options are:
No training is required, provided the cabin crew member’s recency is within the validity of the Recurrent training and the cabin crew member has operated on Operator A aircraft type during the last 6 months. 
Recurrent training if the validity is about to expire.
Refresher training, provided the cabin crew member has not operated on Operator A aircraft type for more than 6 months.
Refresher training, if Operator A considers this training to be necessary due to complex equipment or procedures for the cabin crew member who has been absent from flying duties for less than 6 months.
Aircraft type specific and operator conversion training & Familiarisation if the validity of the Recurrent training has expired.

                    Passenger safety briefing                  




        
            
                Is there any requirement on what language(s) should be used for information provided to passengers via safety briefings and announcements?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 Air Operations, Annex III: Part-ORO is available on EASA website. ICAO Doc 10086 Manual on information and instructions for passenger safety is available on ICAO website.
Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 mandates the operator to ensure that briefings and demonstrations related to safety are provided to passengers in a form that facilitates the application of the procedures applicable in case of an emergency and that passengers are provided with a safety briefing card on which picture type-instructions indicate the operation of emergency equipment and exits likely to be used by passengers. It is therefore the operator’s responsibility to choose the languages to be used on its flights, which may vary depending on the destination or a known passenger profile. It is indeed difficult, if not impossible, to accommodate every ‘required’ language on board as this differs on daily basis from a flight to flight. For example, a German airline has a flight departing from Frankfurt to Rome and it is assumed that the most required languages on this flight will be German and Italian. The passenger profile may, however, be such that these languages are not ‘desired’ on this flight as passengers do not necessarily speak or understand any of the two languages (passengers may be e.g. Irish, Canadian, Russian, Chinese, Iranian, Egyptian, Pakistani, Latvian, Finnish, Croatian, Hungarian, Bulgarian, Czech, Slovak, etc., or there is a large group of e.g. Japanese tourists). It is therefore a practice of some operators to employ ‘language speakers’, i.e. cabin crew members speaking certain languages, who mainly operate their language-desired route(s). The aircraft may also have an option of a multi-language pre-recorded set of public announcements, the operator may choose this feature when modifying the cabin systems on its aircraft configuration. 
ICAO Doc 10086 recommends that information provided to passengers via safety briefings, announcements and safety demonstrations should be transmitted in the language of the operator and in English to promote appropriate communication with passengers. Further, that in order to cover the largest percentage of passengers on board on international flights, the operator should consider the use of English and the use of the official language of the State of departure and destination. In addition, the operator should consider the language(s) of the passengers on board and assign language-qualified cabin crew members or interpreters on board the aircraft, on specific routes. The operator should verify that emergency exit-row occupants comprehend the language spoken by the crew.

                What is the definition of ‘cabin crew member’? Does the definition of Aircrew include cabin crew members?            



 Commission Regulation (EU) No 290/2012 on Aircrew gives the following definitions:
Article 1 (2)(11) defines ‘cabin crew member’ as follows:
(11) “Cabin crew member” means an appropriately qualified crew member, other than a flight crew or technical crew member, who is assigned by an operator to perform duties related to the safety of passengers and flight during operations;
Article 1 (2)(12) defines Aircrew as follows:
(12) “Aircrew” means flight crew and cabin crew; To conclude, the definition of aircrew includes cabin crew member.

                Are there any requirements for loadmasters?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations, Annex IV (Part-CAT)
There are no specific provisions for loadmasters, either in terms of their duties or in terms of their qualification. The only provision applicable to loading is in Part-CAT:
CAT.POL.MAB.100 Mass and balance, loading
CAT.POL.MAB.105 Mass and balance data and documentation, stating:
The loading of an aircraft shall be performed under the supervision of qualified personnel in a way that is consistent with the results of mass and balance calculations.
The person supervising the loading of the aircraft shall confirm by hand signature or equivalent that the load and its distribution are in accordance with the mass and balance documentation given to the commander.
The person who prepared the mass and balance documentation must be named on it.
The operator has to specify principles and methods for the loading and the mass and balance system in use in its Operations Manual.
Regarding the categorization of such personnel, a loadmaster can be either ground personnel or a crew member if the operator assigns him/her duties on board (as it is the case for some cargo operators), but certainly not flight crew.
Of course this does not prevent a flight crew member to be also qualified as a loadmaster, but he or she would be flight crew independently from being a loadmaster at the same time.
Please note that in accordance with ORO.GEN.110(e), it is the operator's responsibility to “ensure that all personnel assigned to, or directly involved in, ground and flight operations are properly instructed, have demonstrated their abilities in their particular duties and are aware of their responsibilities and the relationship of such duties to the operation as a whole”.

                Referring to Annex II - AMC 20-6 rev.2, on ETOPS Applicability, is ETOPS approval required or not for aircraft with a seating configuration of 19 or less and a maximum take-off mass of less than 45 360 kg and not exceeding 180 minutes at the approved one-engine-inoperative speed (in still air) from an adequate aerodrome?            



 “(2) or Two-engine aeroplanes with a maximum passenger seating configuration of 19 or less and a maximum take-off mass of less than 45 360 kg, in excess of 180 minutes at the approved one-engine-inoperative speed (in still air) from an adequate aerodrome.”
Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations, Annex IV (Part CAT), Annex V (Part SPA)
In the EASA regulatory framework an ETOPS operational approval is not required for commercial operations with twin-engine aeroplanes with a maximum passenger seating configuration of 19 or less and a maximum take-off mass of less than 45 360 kg to operate in excess of 180 minutes at the approved one-engine-inoperative speed (in still air) from an adequate aerodrome.
Nevertheless, Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 must be considered, especially CAT.OP.MPA.140 which states:
“CAT.OP.MPA.140 Maximum distance from an adequate aerodrome for two-engined aeroplanes without an ETOPS approval
(a) Unless approved by the competent authority in accordance with Annex V (Part SPA), Subpart F, the operator shall not operate a two-engined aeroplane over a route that contains a point further from an adequate aerodrome, under standard conditions in still air, than:
	[...]
(2) for performance class A aeroplanes with:
(i) an MOPSC of 19 or less; and 
			(ii) a maximum take-off mass less than 45 360 kg,
the distance flown in 120 minutes or, subject to approval by the competent authority, up to 180 minutes for turbo-jet aeroplanes, at the OEI cruise speed determined in accordance with (b);”


Therefore, a specific ETOPS approval under Part-SPA (Annex V to Regulation (EU) No 965/2012) is not required to operate between 120 and 180 minutes from an adequate aerodrome; nevertheless, an operator is required to hold an approval based on the provisions contained in AMC1 CAT.OP.MPA.140(c). Without this approval, an operator cannot operate in excess of 120 minutes from an adequate aerodrome.

                NPAs CDFA-SA with IAP instrument approach procedure expressing minima as a "DA/H" should have an "ADD-ON" or not? Am I allowed to go a little bellow the "DA/H" while performing a missed approach/going around?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations, Annex IV (Part CAT)
Please note that the rules on CDFA are now specified in the following rule of Regulation (EU) 965/2012: CAT.OP.MPA.115 Approach flight technique - aeroplanes. To this implementing rule, three AMCs and one Guidance Material are assigned.
AMC1 CAT.OP.MPA.115 (a)(5) specifies the following: “This DA/H should take into account any add-on to the published minima as identified by the operator's management system and should be specified in the OM (aerodrome operating minima).” This means that the use of any add-on is left to the responsibility of the operator.
Usually, the operator should avoid going below DA/H if the missed approach is initiated. Therefore, (a)(7) specifies: “The operator should establish a procedure to ensure that an appropriate callout is made when the aeroplane is approaching DA/H. If the required visual references are not established at DA/H, the missed approach procedure is to be executed promptly.”

                Is there any regulatory statement by which it is required for all European aeroplanes to carry a defibrillator on board?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations, Annex IV (Part-CAT)
In the AMCs to the Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations, it is recommended, for commercial air transport operations, to carry an automatic external defibrillator on aeroplanes required to carry an emergency medical kit (those having a passenger seating configuration of more than 30 seats when any point on the planned route is more than 60 minutes flying time at normal cruising speed from an aerodrome at which qualified medical assistance could be expected to be available) under certain conditions.
Namely the acceptable means of compliance to the rule concerned (CAT.IDE.A.225), listing the content of the Emergency Medical Kit, recommend operators to determine through risk assessment the need to carry the defibrillator. So there is no strict requirement for operators, but only a recommendation based on the result of a risk assessment.
The above is in line with the current ICAO Annex 6 recommendation, which reads as follows:
ATTACHMENT B. MEDICAL SUPPLIES
Supplementary to Chapter 6, 6.2.2 a)
1.2 Based on the limited available evidence, only a very small number of passengers are likely to benefit from the carriage of automated external defibrillators (AED) on aeroplanes. However, many operators carry them because they offer the only effective treatment for cardiac fibrillation. The likelihood of use, and therefore of potential benefit to a passenger, is greatest in aircraft carrying a large number of passengers, over long duration sector lengths. The carriage of AEDs should be determined by operators on the basis of a risk assessment taking into account the particular needs of the operation.

                What is the applicability of the data link recording requirements (CAT.IDE.A.195, CAT.IDE.H.195, NCC.IDE.A.170, NCC.IDE.H.170,  SPO.IDE.A.150 and SPO.IDE.H.150)?            



 The requirement to record data link communication messages stated in paragraphs CAT.IDE.A.195, CAT.IDE.H.195, NCC.IDE.A.170, NCC.IDE.H.170, SPO.IDE.A.150 and SPO.IDE.H.150 should be understood as follows: if an aircraft is equipped with data link communication equipment and it is going to use this equipment during part or the entire flight (when also required to be equipped with a CVR and first issued with an individual CofA on or after the applicability date stated in the relevant paragraph), then it must also have a working data link recording function.  The expression ‘where applicable’ in CAT.IDE.A.195(a) is to indicate that the requirement applies when information enumerated in CAT.IDE.A.195(a)(1) is exchanged or could be exchanged via data link replacing voice during the flight. This is also valid for the expression ‘where applicable’ in CAT.IDE.H.195(a), NCC.IDE.A.170(a), NCC.IDE.H.170(a),  SPO.IDE.A.150(a) and SPO.IDE.H.150(a).
Examples where this requirement would not apply include but are not limited to:
the case where the aircraft is only operated in airspace where no data link communication service is offered and therefore only voice communications are used between the aircraft and ATS;
the case where the airborne data link communication equipment is not compatible with the data link services of the airspace where it is operating and therefore, voice remains the means of communication between the aircraft and ATS;
the case where the data link communication equipment is disabled permanently and in a way that it cannot be enabled again during the flight and therefore voice remains the means of communication between the aircraft and ATS.

Note:
Commission Regulation (EU) No 29/2009 requires aircraft performing IFR flights above Flight Level 285 in the airspace of most EASA Member States to ‘have the capability to operate some data link services by February 2020 , except for older aircraft and State aircraft.

                AMC1 (a) to CAT.IDE.A.280 says, “Batteries used in the ELTs should be replaced (or recharged, if the battery is rechargeable) when the equipment has been in use for more than 1 cumulative hour”. What should be understood by “in use for more than 1 cumulative hour”?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations, Annex IV (Part CAT)
“In use for more than 1 cumulative hour” should be understood as an hour of cumulative ELT operation, whatever the purpose may be (testing, intended or unintended transmitting).

                SPA.HEMS.110 Equipment requirements for HEMS operations specifies: "The installation of all helicopter dedicated medical equipment and any subsequent modifications and, where appropriate, its operation shall be approved in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 1702/2003".  Does it mean that even a defibrillator or an oxylog has to be approved in accordance with Regulation (EC) 1702/2003 or (EU) 748/2012? Or does it mean that only the fix installed medical equipment, such as a stretcher or a fix provision, has to be approved?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations, Annex V (Part SPA)
It is not the medical equipment itself that has to be approved in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 748/2012, but its installation on the helicopter. Therefore, if it is a fixed installed equipment, it has to be approved; if it is removable, the housing or any other part which is installed has to be approved. In general terms, the principle applied here is that no kind of equipment (medical or not, installed or not) shall affect the airworthiness or the safe operation of the aircraft even in the case of failures or malfunctions.
This means, for example, that if the equipment is powered by a power source of the aircraft, there shall be no adverse effect on the power source itself or on other systems or parts of the aircraft, or that the equipment is checked and cleared against electromagnetic interference.

                    Dangerous Goods                  




        
            
                Is there a European regulation on dangerous goods training requirements or should each European country follow its own national regulations?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations, Annex III (Part ORO), Annex IV (Part CAT), Annex V (Part SPA), Annex VI (Part NCC), Annex VII (Part NCO)
European rules regarding the transport of dangerous goods can be found in the Commission Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations (Air OPS). Air OPS Regulation substitutes the EU-OPS Regulations. So far, only the rules for commercial air transport and non-commercial operations have been published in Annexes I to VII of the Air OPS. The rules on aerial work (specialised operations) will follow later to complete it.
Apart from the implementing rules which are comprised in the Regulation (EU) 965/2012, the Acceptable Means of Compliance (AMC) and Guidance Material (GM), which are published as EASA Decisions on the Agency's website, should be taken into account as well (namely Decisions 2012/015/R through to 2012/019/R, respectively the amended ones 2013/017/R through to 2013/022/R).
The requirements in ORO.GEN.110, CAT.GEN.MPA.200, SPA.DG.105, NCC.GEN.150 and NCO.GEN.140 are more general, whereas the related AMC/GM (especially AMC1 SPA.DG.105(a) in ED Decision 2013/020/R on Part SPA) include more specific details.
The requirements stipulated in Part I, Chapter 4 of the ICAO Doc 9284-AN/905, Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air, mentioned as a further reference in the Air OPS Regulation, must also be complied with.
In addition, national aviation authorities are responsible for approving the dangerous goods training in their countries and therefore they have to establish the conditions under which they shall be approved. For detailed information on training requirements (including the type of training interaction - classroom or computer-based training), each operator should contact the national aviation authority in their country of registration.

                Q2: What are the rules concerning the carriage of portable air concentrators (POC) on board? Can they be used during the whole flight?            



 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations, Annex IV (Part CAT); Regulation (EC) No 1107/2006 on the right of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air
Portable air concentrators (POC) do not contain oxygen as such; they only concentrate the oxygen in the surrounding area. Therefore they should not be confused with oxygen bottles/cylinders. Under the European regulations, POCs do not have to be approved to be carried and used on board.
As POCs contain batteries, they fall under the definition of portable electronic devices (PEDs).
In accordance with the European regulations (AMC1 CAT.GEN.MPA.140 (b)(2)(i)), medical equipment necessary to support physiological functions (i.e. POCs) does not need to be switched-off during any phases of the flight.
Regulation (EC) No 1107/2006 establishes the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air. Article 4(3) of this Regulation requires an air carrier or its agent to make publicly available the safety requirements and relevant information on restrictions. For more information on Regulation (EC) No 1107/2006, please refer to the Commission's interpretative guidelines on this regulation from 11.06.2012, which has been published on the Commission's website and can be accessed using this link.
If passengers have special needs, they should request more information from the airline at the time of booking.

                Q1: What are the rules for passengers using bottled oxygen on board an aircraft?            



 [NOTE: Q1 and Q2 must be read together as they are closely related.]
Reference: Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations; Regulation (EC) No 1107/2006 on the right of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air
Article 10 of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2006 establishes the rights of disabled persons and persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air. The Regulation also stipulates that air operators should provide assistance, including transportation of medical equipment subject to dangerous goods legislation. Article 4(3) of this Regulation requires an air carrier or its agent to make publicly available the safety requirements and relevant information on restrictions. Annex II to the Regulation stipulates that the relevant legislation on dangerous goods can be invoked to limit the transport of mobility equipment. For more information on Regulation 1107/2006, please refer to the Commission's interpretative guidelines on this regulation from 11.06.2012, which has been published on the Commission's website and can be accessed here.
Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 of 5 October 2012 on Air Operations (Air OPS Regulation) refers to Annex 18 of the Chicago Convention and the Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by air when relating to their carriage on board. For safety reasons, oxygen/air cylinders or bottles are considered dangerous goods and fall under Annex 18 of the Chicago Convention; therefore, the provisions under Part 8 of the ICAO Technical Instructions must be applied to passengers who intend to carry these items with them on board. Oxygen/air cylinders for medical use of no more than 5 kg gross weight and never containing liquid oxygen are allowed in checked and carry-on baggage or on the person, with approval of the operator. In addition, the operator must provide the pilot-in-command with written information on their number and location on board. The valves and regulators of oxygen bottles must be protected from damage which could cause inadvertent release of the contents. Under the ICAO Technical Instructions, spare oxygen cylinders of a similar size are also allowed to ensure an adequate supply for the duration of the journey. The operator's Operations Manual, which has been approved by the National Authority, will contain procedures on the use of oxygen bottles.
Nevertheless, for safety reasons, national authorities may decide to prohibit all oxygen bottles, irrespective of their size, from being carried on board by passengers. Where the national authorities allow oxygen bottles of less than 5 kg to be taken on board, it is still left to the discretion of the operator to accept them, also due to safety reasons (oxygen is highly flammable and it cannot be guaranteed that the bottles/valves have been maintained properly).  
	If passengers have special needs, they should request more information from the airline at the time of booking.

                Which operators have to establish and maintain dangerous goods training programmes? Which training programmes should be approved by the authority?            



 The rule reference is ORO.GEN.110 (j). All operators subject to ORO.GEN.005 must establish and maintain dg training programmes in all cases. The approval, however, is only necessary if:
It is a CAT operation
The operator is transporting dangerous goods and performing:
Commercial specialised operations:
Non-commercial operations with complex motor-powered aircraft; or
Non-commercial specialised operations with complex motor-powered aircraft.

There is also an alleviation in ORO.GEN.110 (k) for operators of sailplanes, balloons, and certain single-engined propeller-driven airplanes and single-engined other-than motor-powered helicopters of 5700 Kg or less of MCTM and an MOPSC of 5 or less operating in a flight taking off and landing at the same aerodrome/operating site under VFR by day, where the requirement is that operators shall ensure that the flight crew has received an appropriate training or briefing to enable them to recognise undeclared dangerous goods brought on-board by passengers or as cargo (refer to the rule for more information).

                Are there differences between the European Air Ops rules for NCC and ICAO SARPs?            



 There are some differences between European Air Ops rules for NCC and ICAO Annex 6 SARPs. However, none of these differences would result in a lower safety level than intended by ICAO. 
The following list describes differences generated by Regulation (EC) 216/2008 and Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 on air operations. 
Differences generated by Reg. (EC) 216/2008:
Aircraft category (difference in drawing the line between complex and non-complex aircraft): some aircraft are considered complex in the European rules, while at ICAO level, they are considered non-complex; European rules exceed ICAO standards. 
Oversight: European rules assign oversight responsibilities to the State of the Operator and not to the State of Registry; European rules achieve the safety target with an alternative method.
Declaration: the operator requirement to declare itself to the competent authority supports authorities to discharge their responsibilities; European rules exceed ICAO standards.
Differences generated by Reg. (EU) No 965/2012 on air operations:
List of specific approvals: European rules exceed ICAO standards; ICAO may require this list by November 2018.

                Do NCC operators with non-EU registered aircraft need to maintain two different Operations Manuals?            



 The European provisions for the structure of the Operations Manual are specified in AMC2 ORO.MLR.100. The structure is very flexible and – where needed – could be amended through an alternative means of compliance.
It is strongly advised that the operator work with a single Operations Manual, which should address the specified minimum items of the State of the Operator and the State of Registry.

                My operations manual (OM) uses a template provided by a recognised industry standard. Is this sufficient for me to be compliant with the rules?              



 An OM template helps an operator to organise its procedures and information that the personnel need in order to accomplish their safety tasks. However, the operator has to make sure that its OM reflects the specificity of its operation – be it commercial or non-commercial. At the same time, the manual should cover the areas described in Subpart ORO.MLR.
In parallel with that, the operator has to ensure also that the operation itself – not just the manual – is compliant with the applicable rules. The requirements related to the operations manual are only a part of the applicable rules.

                What is the intent of the declaration?            



 The intent of the declaration is to:
have the operator acknowledge its responsibilities under the applicable safety regulations and that it holds all necessary approvals;
inform the competent authority of the existence of an NCC or an SPO operator; and
enable the competent authority to fulfil its oversight responsibilities in accordance with ARO.GEN.300 and 305.
When the NCC operation is managed by a third party on behalf of the owner, that party may be the operator in the sense of Article 3(13) of the Basic Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, and therefore has to declare its capability and means to discharge the responsibilities associated with the operation of the aircraft to the competent authority.
In such a case, it should also be assessed whether the third party operator undertakes a commercial operation in the sense of Article 2(1)(d) of Regulation (EU) No 965/2012.

                How can an NCC operator establish if its organisation is complex or non-complex?            



 AMC1 ORO.GEN.200(b) ‘Management system. Size, nature and complexity of the activity’ provides criteria to determine if an operator belongs to the group of complex organisations or the one of non-complex organisations. These criteria are based on the assessment of the size, nature and complexity of the operator’s activity.
The idea behind this AMC is to provide some basic criteria for an organisation (an operator) to establish which AMCs on management system they should follow — the more ‘comprehensive’ ones for complex organisations, or those including some specific ‘alleviations’ for the non-complex ones.   
 
It is important to note that the assessment of organisational complexity is not only a function of size, but it also needs to consider the specific activities, the operating environment, the scope, the variety of different aircraft types operated, the contracted activities, etc. Therefore, the AMC includes some specific risk criteria. 
 
The fact that this AMC is included in Part-ORO indicates that it is the operator’s responsibility to determine the right ‘layout’ of their management system. The competent authority will need to validate this determination during the oversight activities, and it may challenge the operator on the option retained (complex or non-complex). 
At the same time, AMC1 ORO.GEN.200(b) does not include any overly detailed complexity criteria. This is because it is impossible to address all cases and, more importantly, it is not the intent that the AMC be used as a substitute for the operator’s own risk assessment.
The main ‘alleviations’ for a non-complex operator are the following:
The operator may use simple procedures and tools for its safety risk management process (e.g. checklists), and safety performance monitoring and measurement (no need to perform extensive safety studies, surveys, etc.).
The accountable manager or a person with an operational role in the organisation may fulfil the role of safety manager.
The organisation does not need to have a safety review board.
The accountable manager may also be the compliance-monitoring manager if he or she has demonstrated to have the required competence and that the independence of the internal audits is maintained.
Simple checklists may be used to document compliance monitoring audits and inspections.
Before the operator decides which AMCs to follow, it should demonstrate proper understanding of the risks entailed by its activities. Upon initial implementation of the EASA management system framework, the organisation will normally start describing and analysing its activity and processes, to determine not only how best to implement the management system framework, but also where to focus the risk management efforts. Not investing in this step will lead to inefficient/costly management system implementation and require subsequent rework.
Such system description and related analysis will be an effective means for identifying hazards proactively. It will also create a baseline for the management of changes and will allow identifying safety performance requirements for safety relevant processes, as well as related performance indicators and controls in order to manage the defined performance goals.

                Is the European State of the Operator principle for NCC operations in contradiction to the Chicago Convention?            



 The standards and recommended practices (SARPs) of ICAO Annex 6, Part II are based on the State of Registry (SoR) principle.
The European rules for NCC operations are based on the State of the Operator (SoO) principle.
This does not constitute a contradiction to the Chicago Convention but rather establishes a complementary safety instrument, particularly when a European operator uses third-country registered aircraft.
The SoR is responsible for the oversight of the aircraft in its registry. The EU SoO is responsible for the oversight of operators having their principal place of business in an EU Member State. Although the EU SoO is the competent authority for the operators having their principal place of business in an EU Member State, the EU SoO and the foreign SoR should cooperate in order to ensure proper oversight of these operators, in compliance with the ICAO requirements.
When the SoR and the SoO are both EU Member States, they oversee the aircraft, as well as the organisations and personnel involved in their operation in a complementary manner and according to the same rules. The European regulatory framework permits both the SoR and the SoO to duly exercise their respective oversight responsibilities and to take the appropriate enforcement actions. Oversight and enforcement are therefore ensured at all times, irrespective of the EU Member State in which the aircraft is registered or where the operations take place. It is at all times legally clear which EU Member State is responsible for each aspect of the safety oversight of any aircraft registered in an EU Member State and operated by an operator having its principal place of business in an EU Member State acting as SoO.

                Is a CAMO required for a European NCC operator using a third-country registered aircraft?            



 European Implementing rules for continuing airworthiness (EU) 2014/1321 do not apply to European NCC operators for third-country registered aircraft unless the regulatory oversight has been delegated to an EU Member State.
In particular, tasks related to the continuing airworthiness management do not need to be implemented by a CAMO in the sense of Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014. However, the essential requirements established in Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 (the “Basic Regulation”) must be complied with. For airworthiness, the elements required in Annex V point 6 must be ensured by an organisation as required in point 8.8.
In short, European NCC operators of third-country registered aircraft need to ensure that an organisation is managing the continuing airworthiness of their aircraft and that this organisation is able to demonstrate that the aircraft comply with the continuing airworthiness requirements contained in Annex V of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 (the "Basic Regulation"). This organisation does not need to be a CAMO; it can be the operator itself or any other organisation or natural person under the responsibility of the operator.

                Why are non-commercial operations treated in two Parts, i.e. Part NCC (non-commercial with complex motor-powered aircraft and a Part NCO (non-commercial with other-than-complex motor-powered-aircraft)?            



 The rules concerning non-commercial operations are developed separately for complex motor-powered aircraft (MPA) and other-than-complex MPA because it does not make sense to have the same requirements apply to operations with an Airbus 320 for example and a Cessna 172. This way, the principle of proportionality of rules is preserved.

                Which is the competent authority responsible for the oversight of the NCC operations in Europe?            



 NCC.GEN.100 specifies the following: “The competent authority shall be the authority designated by the Member State in which the operator has its principal place of business or is residing”.  
	This means that the State of the Operator (SoO) designates the competent authority for NCC operators. Here are some examples:
For a European NCC operator with aircraft registered in a Member State, the Competent Authority is designated by the State of the Operator.
For a European NCC operator with third-country registered aircraft, the Competent Authority is designated by the State of the Operator. These operators may also have to comply with rules of the third-country State of Registry (SoR) if this State has not delegated its responsibilities to the European State of the Operator.
For a third-country NCC operator having its principal place of business in a third country and performing operations with aircraft registered in a Member State, the Competent Authority is designated by the State of the Operator (the third country SoO). However, these operators may also have to comply with rules of the EU Member State (State of Registry) related to the aircraft if the State of Registry has not delegated its responsibilities to the State of the Operator.
For cases under (2) and (3), the State of Registry and the State of the Operator need to coordinate their safety and security oversight actions in accordance with ICAO SARPs (3.4.2.1.2 of ICAO Annex 6 Part II).
To avoid interferences with the responsibility of a third-country State of Registry for specific approvals, Part-SPA SPA.GEN.100 specifies that the European competent authority shall not issue operational approvals when they are required by Annex 6 and issued by the third-country State of Registry. 
EASA has published a draft Guidance Material (GM) related to this topic, in order to make it easier for declared operators (NCC and SPO) to determine which their competent authority is. The GM can be found in the draft AMC&GM related to Opinion 04/2017, published for information 'draft GM proposed to Annex I Definitions'.

 Appendix V of the Authority Requirements (Part-ARO) contains a list of specific approvals for non-commercial operations and specialised operations. This list replicates in a proportionate manner the OpSpecs template for CAT operations.
The reasons for this list are to standardise the documentation of specific approvals for non-commercial operators and to support ramp inspectors in their oversight activities.

                Do the European rules recognise if an operator conforms to European industry standards?            



 The European rule recognises the compliance with European industry standards.
The declaration form specified in the Organisation Requirements (Part-ORO, Appendix 1) requires operators to declare if they conform to an industry standard. Any compliance with a recognised European industry standard should be taken into account by the competent authority when planning and implementing their risk-based oversight activities. The competent authority may adapt its oversight programme, in order to avoid duplication of specific audit items.
This is further described in AMC1 ARO.GEN.305(b);(d);(d1) ‘Oversight programme’ and AMC1 ARO.GEN.305(b);(c);(d);(d1) ‘Oversight programme’.

                How should I start building my SMS if I have a very small organisation (up to 2-3 persons) and I operate a complex aeroplane or helicopter?            



 A good starting point would be to describe your regular operation, the daily business. The description of your operation will give direction to your organisation’s effective SMS and will become its foundation.
This description should simply be a checklist containing the day-to-day activities, as it provides the understanding necessary to identify and manage the risks associated with the operation.
The analysis of your daily operation should consider the following aspects (this list is not exhaustive):
What is the frequency of your flights?
What aircraft type(s) do you have in your fleet?
What are your departure & destination points?
What is specific to the aerodromes you use?
Which are the routes on which you fly – more or less the same routes or very different routes?
Do you carry passengers?
What type of operation do you perform on those routes? Be as specific as you can.
Do you have a system that helps you prepare your flight?
How do you plan and calculate the necessary fuel supply?
Do you have any specific approvals (e.g., LVO, PBN, etc.)?
Are your pilots’ training and qualifications compliant with the requirements? How about the other employees involved in operation?
Are the operational procedures and any flight documents current and available to all the personnel involved in operation?
How do you ensure that the necessary information is communicated to the right persons involved in operation?
How do you ensure aircraft maintenance?
What do you do if any of the elements above changes for one reason or another? Are you prepared to cope with that change and minimise its effects in your daily operation? How do you deal with such changes?
Make sure you include the aspect of disruptive changes in your analysis.
Have you set up the minimum levels of acceptance to which every key operational activity (e.g. scheduling, planning, flight execution, fuel consumption, training, aircraft maintenance) can go? In other words, have you set up your performance expectations?
The last two questions will lead to the second step in building your SMS:
What could be the main potential risks associated to each of the elements above – what could go wrong with these daily variables?
Identifying the key elements of risk in this day-to-day operation will help you to spot more easily the strengths and weaknesses in your regular business, the errors, as well as the good practices.
The third step is then to choose/apply adequate mitigation measures to reduce the risks inherent to your daily operation:
Make a list of solutions to reduce each risk to an acceptable level. Consider to use the Risk register checklist proposed in GM3 ORO.GEN.200(a)(3) for your safety risk management/assessment.
A fourth step is to assess whether the mitigation measures that you have prepared are effective and help you to achieve the required level of safety.
Keep evidence of any occurrence, identify their cause, and see if they are repetitive and if they have anything in common.
Find ways to prevent them from reoccurring by addressing the “root cause”.
Check how well your solutions helped in preventing the reoccurrence of that event.
A fifth step ensures that the whole process becomes cyclic, and that you learn from your previous experience in order to make your operation safer and more efficient.
Run this check once a year or after an event or change in the aspects mentioned above.
Does this scheme address your needs and help you to have a safe operation?

                We are an aero-club authorised by Member State X to perform skydiving operations. We operate a non-complex aircraft dry-leased from an operator registered in Member State Y. Our skydivers and the tandem passengers are registered members of the aero-club; there is no profit distributed outside our organisation. Which Parts of Regulation (EU) 965/2012 apply to us? Which is our competent authority?            



 As an organisation (aero club) approved under the national legislation of Member State X, the national legislation of State X applies to you, to the skydivers, to the tandem passengers and all other registered members. Reg. (EU) No 1178/2011 on aircrew is not applicable to aero clubs that do not provide training for one of the Part-FCL licences and ratings — LAPL, PPL, CPL or ATPL.
The operation of the aircraft must be performed in accordance with Part-NCO of Reg. (EU) No 965/2012 on air operations, as the aircraft you operate is a non-complex aircraft.
The competent authority for the oversight of your dry-leased aircraft is the State of registry, that is, the state where your aircraft is registered (see Reg. (EU) No 965/2012, NCO.GEN.100 ‘Competent authority’). However, the competent authority of Member State Y may delegate its oversight tasks to the competent authority of Member State X.

                Does an NCO operator established in an EU Member State and operating an aircraft registered in a third country need to comply with the Airworthiness Directives (AD) issued by EASA, in addition to the ADs issued by the State of Registry?            



 Reg. (EU) No 965/2012 NCO.GEN.145 point (b) states: ‘The operator shall implement […] (b) any relevant mandatory safety information issued by the Agency, including airworthiness directives.’
For NCO operations in the EU of a third country-registered aircraft, only the ADs mandated by the State of Registry apply — not the EASA ADs.
The word ‘relevant’ in point (b) of NCO.GEN.145 should be understood as ‘if applicable’ and allows to distinguish the different situation of an aircraft registered in an EASA Member State (ADs issued by EASA are relevant to these aircraft) as opposed to third-country registered aircraft, on which ADs mandated by the third-country State of Registry should be applied (refer to Annex 8 to the Chicago Convention).
It is common that ADs first issued by the State of Design are identically (or very similarly) issued or adopted by all States of Registry concerned. By European law (article 77 of Reg. (EU) 2018/1139, the so-called Basic Regulation (BR)), EASA performs State of Design functions on behalf of the EASA Member States. 
Note 1: In accordance with Article 83-bis of the Chicago Convention, if agreed, the country where an aircraft is registered may transfer the oversight functions (including airworthiness) to the country of the aircraft operator. If, in such case, the operator is established or resides in an EASA Member State, EASA ADs are relevant to this aircraft. 
Note 2: In accordance with article 77 of the BR, aircraft registered in an EASA Member State are required to comply with EASA-issued or adopted ADs. As per ED Decision No. 2/2003, EASA adopts ADs issued by the State of Design unless the Agency decides differently. Read more about ADs applicable to EASA Member State-registered aircraft in the EASA FAQ page on ADs.

                How to distinguish between a ‘commercial’ SPO operator and a ‘non-commercial’ SPO operator?            



 ‘Commercial’ or ’non-commercial’ operation - Reference: Reg. (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations: Article 5
A commercial SPO operator is an operator who performs or intends to perform commercial non-transport operation such as specialised operations by receiving remuneration or other valuable consideration against those services. 
	Sometimes the distinction between ‘commercial’ and ‘non-commercial’ is not easily evident, especially when the remuneration or another way of compensation is not formalised e.g. a farmer comes with its own aircraft to spray crops to another farmer, against some compensation agreed verbally between the parties. 
	A clear example of non-commercial SPO operator is a farmer spraying his crops with his plane.
	Competent authorities responsible for the oversight of SPO operators and operations should assess carefully each individual case to establish if there is a commercial operation, resorting if necessary to information otherwise available to social security or taxation bodies.
	Specialised operations (SPO) are not commercial air transport (CAT) operation; hence, passengers cannot be transported during a SPO mission flight. However, task specialists may be carried during such a flight.

                Are we a ‘complex’ or ‘non-complex’ operator considering the fact that we have five FTEs and four types of non-complex helicopters?            



 Size and complexity of the operator - Reference: Reg. (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations: ORO.GEN.200 (b)  
	AMC1 ORO.GEN.200 (b) paragraph (a) defines how to assess if an operator is complex or non-complex: 
	The operator is non-complex if its workforce is less than 20 full time equivalents (FTEs). However, point AMC1 ORO.GEN.200 (b) paragraph (b) indicates that an operator with less than 20 FTEs may also be considered complex if, for example, it performs high-risk commercial SPO or operates in a challenging environment (offshore, mountainous area, etc.).
	Prior to sending a declaration an operator should check with the competent authority, if their assessment of complexity is correct.

                Can I use third-country registered aircraft for my SPO operations?            



 Third country registered aircraft - References: Reg. (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations; Reg. (EU) No 748/2012 on initial airworthiness
	In accordance with ORO.SPO.100 (b), the aircraft used in commercial SPO (SPO-COM) shall have a certificate of airworthiness (CofA) issued by an EU Member State in accordance with Reg. (EU) No 748/2012 or shall be leased-in in accordance with ORO.SPO.100 (c). This means that operators conducting SPO-COM must operate aircraft registered in an EU MS or, alternatively, leased-in aircraft registered outside the EU.
	In non-commercial SPO operations (SPO-NCC and SPO-NCO), there is no requirement with regard to the State of registration of aircraft.
	For operations, such as parachute dropping, sailplane towing or aerobatic flights with non-complex motor powered aircraft, eligible for the exemption under SPO.GEN.005 (c), there is no requirement with regard to the registration of aircraft either.

                We operate a helicopter that is Annex II aircraft according to the Basic Regulation. How should we continue to conduct SPO now? Do we need any exemption?            



 Annex II aircraft - Reference: Reg. (EU) 2018/1139 (The Basic Regulation): Annex I 
	The use of Annex I aircraft in SPO activities is not regulated at EU level. You may be allowed to continue carrying out SPO with you Annex I helicopter or aeroplane, if this is permitted under your country national regulation. Please ask your competent authority what conditions apply to SPO operations with Annex I aircraft in your country.
	Note, however, that any authorisation or certificate required by your national legislation may not be recognised by other Member States.

                Why may a SPO operator not carry on board passengers on an aerobatic flight?            



 Passengers - Reference: Reg. (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations: Article 5(7) 
Except for crew members, persons other than those indispensable to the mission shall not be carried on board of flights, which take place immediately before, during or immediately after specialized operations and are directly connected to those operations. 
	When SPO related rules apply to a flight or a number of flights, passengers (fare paying or not) cannot be carried on board such flights. In some SPO operations, the concept of “passenger” and “task specialist” do blend into each other. Therefore, for regulatory and risk mitigation purposes persons carried on board are considered task specialists, even if their “task” is to enjoy 0-G flight, a tandem jump, or a looping. The rules call for task specialists to be instructed on their tasks, including the risks connected to those tasks of which they are not sufficiently or at all informed. 
	If passengers are being transported, the flight has to be performed in accordance with Part-CAT or Part-NCC or Part-NCO, as applicable.

                Now, thanks to Art. 6 (8) of Reg. (EU) 965/2012, I operate non-commercially a twin turbo-propeller aircraft below 5.7 t MCTOM in accordance with Part-NCO. May I also carry out non-commercial specialised operations with the same aircraft under Part-NCO?            



 Twin turboprops at or below 5.7 t MCTOM - Reference: Reg. (EU) No 965/2012 on Air Operations: Article 6(8)
	The derogation of Art 6(8) of Regulation 965/2012 does not apply to non-commercial specialised operations or to commercial operations. It is only applicable to ‘pure’ non-commercial operations of complex motor-powered aeroplanes with a maximum certificated take-off mass (MCTOM) at or below 5 700 kg, equipped with turboprop engines. When operating such aircraft the operators shall comply with Part-NCO, instead of Part-NCC and Part-ORO.

                Is it permissible for me to determine myself whether the operations I conduct are eligible for the alleviation of SPO.GEN.005 (c)?            



 Limited operations - Reference: Reg. (EU) No 965/2012 on air operations: SPO.GEN.005 (c)
	The purpose of SPO.GEN.005 (c) is to alleviate certain flights that might otherwise be qualified as commercial (where compliance with Part-SPO is required) to comply with the less demanding rules of Part-NCO.  
	The operator must check with the competent authority whether the operations it conducts are eligible for the alleviation of SPO.GEN.005 (c). The competent authority makes the final determination.

                What do the terms ‘marginal activity’, ‘direct cost’, ‘annual cost’ and ‘organisation created with the aim of promoting aerial sport or leisure aviation’ mean?            



 ‘Marginal activity’, ‘Direct cost’… - Reference: Reg. (EU) No 965/2012 on air operations: SPO.GEN.005 (c)
	These terms are used in SPO.GEN.005 (c) as well as in Article 6, paragraph 4a of Reg. (EU) No 965/2012.
	Their meaning, in the context of Reg. (EU) No 965/2012, can be found in the guidance material placed under Article 6, paragraph 4a. The same meaning is also applicable for the purpose SPO.GEN.005 (c).
	As regards ‘marginal activity’, AMC1 ARO.OPS.300 also applies in the case of parachute dropping, sailplane towing or aerobatic flights. This is because whenever a competent authority publishes criteria specifying to which extent it considers an activity marginal and how this is being overseen, the nature of flight (introductory, parachute dropping, sailplane towing or aerobatic flights) has little importance.

                Are we high-risk or non-high-risk commercial specialised operator?            



 Reference: Reg. (EU) No 965/2012 on air operations: Article 2 (8) 
	Each competent authority may decide for their territory which commercial SPO operation poses a high risk, in particular to third parties on the ground. If you operate in the Member State where you are residing or your organisation is established or has its principal place of business, this is your competent authority; if you operate in another Member State, this is the competent authority designated by that Member State.
	Even if the competent authority has not established its list of high-risk commercial SPO operations, the operator must determine through a risk assessment whether a particular operation is posing high risk to third parties on the ground in the event of an emergency. 
	The competent authority should publish and regularly update the list of high-risk SPO for their territory. 
	For more information, please refer to various publications about the high-risk SPO operations in the Member States available on this webpage,  including the Guidelines for cross-border high-risk commercial SPO.

                Do I need two authorisations, if the lists of high-risk commercial SPO of different Member States differ?            



 Reference: Reg. (EU) No 965/2012 on air operations: ARO.OPS.150 (f)
	No, you do not. Where the cross-border SPO operation you are planning to carry out is on the list of high-risk SPO established by the competent authority of the place of operation,  you shall seek authorisation from your own competent authority, irrespective of whether that authority considers this particular operation ‘high risk’ or not. This is because in the EU the HR authorisation issued by your competent authority under Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 is recognised as valid by the competent authority of another Members State. 
	For that purpose, the competent authorities involved will coordinate the validation process. The safety considerations of the competent authority of the place where the operation will be conducted need to be accounted for; both competent authorities need to be satisfied with the operator’s risk assessment and standard operating procedures - SOPs.
	For more information, please refer to various publications about the high-risk SPO operations in the Member States available on this webpage,  including the Guidelines for cross-border high-risk commercial SPO.

                What is the meaning of "applicable national flight time limitation legislation" in Article 8 (4) of regulation 965/2012?            



 Cross-border commercial SPO - Reference: Reg. (EU) No 965/2012 on air operations: Art. 8(4)
	Article 8 (4) of Regulation 965/2012 foresees that specialised operators continue to comply with applicable national flight time limitation legislation until EU implementing rules are adopted and apply.
	In the context of Part-SPO, the intent of ‘applicable national flight time limitation legislation’ with regard to specialised operators is understood to mean the national law of the Member State in which the operator has its principal place of business, or, where the operator has no principal place of business, the place where the operator is established or resides.

                My SPO operations fall under Part-SPO. What type of certification shall I expect from my competent authority – AOC or other type?            



 AOC or other certification - Reference: Reg. (EU) No 965/2012 on air operations: Part-ORO and Part-SPO
	You are not required to obtain an air operator certificate (AOC). You are however required to submit a declaration to your competent authority. Please make sure that the Declaration is properly completed.
	In addition, depending on the operations you conduct, you might need a specific approval for one or more of these: RVSM, MNPS, RNP AR APCH, LVO and DG.
	In some cases of high-risk commercial SPO, an authorisation may be required.

 Declaration - Reference: Reg. (EU) No 965/2012 on air operations: ORO.DEC.100
	Every SPO operator (commercial and non-commercial), except NCO-SPO, submits a declaration. 
	An operator may perform both commercial and non-commercial flights with complex motor-powered aircraft based on one declaration.
	Operators are not required to submit a declaration before each flight, but must submit a new declaration in the case of changes.

                Is the skydiving activity itself under the scope of Regulation (EU) No 965/2012?            



 Skydiving/parachute dropping
	Parachutes are completely outside Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 (the Basic Regulation), on account that they are not an aircraft.
	In addition, the way people do skydiving (parachute jumps/tandem jumps) does not belong to the scope of Regulation 965/2012.
	Regulation (EU) No 965/2012 applies to the flight operation of bringing parachutists at the required level for the execution of the jumps.

                Can I fly an aeroplane for commercial parachute dropping operation with my PPL (A)?            



 Parachute dropping - Reference: Reg. (EU) No 965/2012 on air operations: Art. 6(4a); Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 on Aircrew: Art. 3(2) 
	The holder of an LAPL or a PPL may conduct parachute-dropping flights, only if the conditions stipulated in Art 6 (4a) of Reg. (EU) No 965/2012 are met. 
	In all other cases, only pilots who hold at least a CPL can conduct SPO flights in accordance with Part-SPO.
	Holders of a PPL (A) with instructor/examiner ratings may receive remuneration for providing training, testing and checking related to LAPL (A) and PPL (A), as well as associated ratings and certificates. 
	The PPL holder cannot receive remuneration for conducting operations other than those listed in FCL.205.A of Reg. (EU) No 1178/2011, as well as for any of the flights mentioned in Article 6 (4a) of Reg. (EU) No 965/2012.

                Is 'MOPSC' (Maximum Operational Passenger Seating Configuration') applicable in case of parachute dropping, where only task specialists are carried?            



 MOPSC - Reference: Reg. (EU) No 965/2012 on air operations: SPO.IDE.A.130
For the purpose of SPO.IDE.A.130, only one of the two values is used: either MCTOM of more than 5 700 kg or MOPSC of more than nine.
MOPSC is established for operational purposes. Where MOPSC is not established or is not relevant for a particular operation, the value of MCTOM should be used.

 Declaration - Reference: Reg. (EU) No 965/2012 on air operations: ORO.DEC.100
	A declaration is not meant to provide information about the nature of a flight at a particular moment. The ATS flight plan, if applicable, and/or the Journey log contain information on the nature of a particular flight.

                If I hold an AOC and want to perform SPO activities (commercial and non-commercial) with the same aircraft registered on my AOC, do I have to submit a declaration too?            



 Mixed operations - Reference: Reg. (EU) No 965/2012 on air operations: ORO.DEC.100
	Yes. SPO operations are not covered by the AOC certification process. Therefore, an AOC holder when conducting SPO missions will have to comply fully with Part-SPO and its associated procedures. This means that the AOC holder must submit a declaration, as well as apply for a high-risk authorisation, if it performs high-risk commercial SPO activities. The aircraft used for the SPO activities are listed on the declaration and in the operations manual.
	However, you do not have to submit a declaration, if you operate NCO-SPO i.e. non-commercial specialised operations with other-than complex motor-powered aircraft.

                Must an operator holding specific approvals (SPAs) for its CAT operations apply for the same SPAs when it also conducts specialised operations?            



 Specific approvals (SPA) for mixed operations - Reference: Reg. (EU) No 965/2012 on air operations: ARO.OPS.200(b)
	Duplications should be avoided whenever possible. However, a separate SPA approval might be needed if:
	(a)    for its specialised operations the operator has a different training programme or has different operating procedures;
	(b)    the validity of the SPA included in the OPSSPECS has expired; or
	(c)    for its specialised operations the operator will use aircraft that are not included in its AOC and for which it does not have any SPA yet.
	The operator does not have to duplicate in its operations manuals the procedures and training for the SPA used for SPO when they are the same as the ones used for CAT operations; a cross-reference, specified in its operations manual, to the place where the training and operating procedures are already detailed, is enough.

                Is it allowed to perform specialised operations with a permit-to-fly or is a CofA mandatory at all times?            



 Permit-to-fly - Reference: Reg. (EU) No 965/2012: ORO.SPO.100 (b); SPO.GEN.140; and NCO.GEN.135
	Aircraft used in commercial specialised operations that fall under Part-SPO, must have a certificate of airworthiness (CofA) in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 748/2012 or may be wet leased-in from a third country operator or dry leased-in by an EU operator while being registered in a third country.
	For commercial specialised operations as well as for any other specialised operation that fall under Part-SPO, the original certificate of airworthiness (CofA) need to be carried on each SPO flight (SPO.GEN.140 (a) (3)).
	According to AMC1 SPO.GEN.140(a)(3) a permit to fly may (PtF) be used in SPO operations, if issued in accordance with the applicable airworthiness requirements and subject to compliance with the flight conditions established by the competent authority.  
	The applicable airworthiness requirements are those contained in Commission Regulation (EU) No 748/2012 (Part-21 thereof). Part-21 contains a list of purposes for which a PtF may be issued under certain conditions. For example, a mission for air racing may be possible with PtF. Please check with your competent authority if the purpose of the SPO mission complies with that list and those conditions.
	For non-commercial specialised operations falling under Part-NCO, NCO.GEN.135 (a) (3) requires the original certificate of airworthiness (CofA) be carried on each flight.
	According to AMC1 NCO.GEN.135 (a) (3) a PtF may be used in NCO operations, if issued in accordance with the applicable airworthiness requirements and subject to compliance with the flight conditions established by the competent authority.  
	The applicable airworthiness requirements are those contained in Part-21. Part-21 contains a list of purposes for which a PtF may be issued under certain conditions. For example, a non-commercial flying activity on individual non-complex aircraft or types for which a certificate of airworthiness or restricted certificate of airworthiness is not appropriate (mainly, but not limited to, the so-called ‘orphan’ aircraft) may be possible with PtF. Please check with your competent authority if the purpose of the SPO mission complies with that list and those conditions.

                Can we integrate the processes for a permission under Part-SERA and with high-risk authorisation (HRA) under Part-ARO?            



 Yes, it is possible, but this decision belongs to the competent authority. Competent authorities may, for example, consider the following option:
for flights over the congested areas of cities, towns or settlements or over an open-air assembly of persons, issuing only HRA. If such flights are to be operated below 300m, the HRA may integrate the permission under Part-SERA, without a separate procedure; and
for flights elsewhere and not over an open-air assembly of persons, 
below 150 m, issuing permission under Part-SERA only. This permission may integrate potential risks under Part-SPO;
above 150 m, requiring neither HRA nor permission.

                Can I carry out ‘limited operations’ with aircraft having FC/PtF for NCO ?            



 Reference: Reg. (EU) No 965/2012 on air operations, Article 6 (4a) and SPO.GEN.005(c)
The term ‘Limited operations’ (used in Regulation (EU) No 2015/1536) refers to certain specialised operations of other-than-complex motor-powered aircraft (SPO-NCO), such as competition flights, flying displays, parachute dropping, sailplane towing and aerobatic flights. Under strict conditions specified in Article 6 (4a) and SPO.GEN.005(c) of Reg. (EU) No 965/2012, those operations may be conducted in accordance with Part-NCO, and in particular subpart E thereof.
AMC1 NCO.GEN.135 (a) (3) specifies that an aircraft may be operated with a permit to fly issued in accordance with the applicable airworthiness requirements.
Thus, in the case of aircraft registered in an EU Member State and used in SPO-NCO, the permit to fly (PtF) is issued in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) 748/2012 (Part-21 thereof) depending of the purpose. 
If the above conditions are met, it is possible to perform the so called ‘Limited operations’ under Part-NCO and its subpart E as long as the aircraft have a PtF for non-commercial flying under Part-21 and the operation is compatible with or is covered by the corresponding flight conditions (FC). 
For aircraft registered in a third country, the same applies, except that the PtF/FC must be issued in accordance with that third country legislation.

                Do additional equipment for HEC (ropes, harnesses) now require an airworthiness approval?            



 Reference: AMC1 SPO.SPEC.HEC.100
 
AMC3 27.865; AMC3 29.865
 
The deletion of paragraph (c)(3) of AMC1 SPO.SPEC.HEC.100 was made in anticipation of a change in SPO.SPEC.HEC.105, as proposed in Opinion 04/2017. Paragraph (c)(3) was identical to the current paragraph (c)(3) of AMC1 SPO.SPEC.HESLO.100. 
	 
The proposed changes in the rules are consistent with the current certification memorandum on Personnel carrying device systems (PCDS) and also consistent with the latest amendments to CS 27/29, by not requiring airworthiness approvals for simple PCDS. 
	 
Ropes, nets and harnesses may still be manufactured according to officially recognised standards. The acceptable means of compliance no longer explicitly says so, but the situation hasn’t changed.

                Which standards are applicable to Helicopter terrain awareness systems (HTAWS)?             



 Reference: SPA.HOFO.160(c)
HTAWS are currently mandated under SPA.HOFO.160(c), which requires HTAWS to ‘meet the requirements for class A equipment as specified in an acceptable standard’.
	The only defined standards for H-TAWS are TSO-C194 and ETSO-C194, which both refer to Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA) document DO-309. Any H-TAWS meeting these standards, or coming with improved features, is acceptable. 
	UK CAP 1519 specifications are considered to introduce improvements to the existing standards. They are designed to reduce false warnings. They also introduce Helicopter Flight Envelope Warnings (H-FEWs) in addition to basic HTAWS functions. A CAP 1519 compliant HTAWS is therefore acceptable. 
	The HTAWS rulemaking task (RMT.708) may change the requirements for HTAWS in the future.

                Is it possible to be exempt from the requirement to be equipped with collision avoidance logic version 7.1 ( ACAS II V7.1) for a limited period of time, for only one flight, for the execution of  a ferry flight per maintenance purposes, for the execution of a non-commercial air transport flight (i.e. general aviation flight) or for a State flight? And what if I have technical difficulties to upgrade my aircraft before 01/12/2015?            



 Compliance with Commission Regulation (EU) No 1332/2011 is required by 01 December 2015 and no general exemptions provisions were included in the regulation that would permit continued operations or for the execution of a single flight, for whatever reason. Furthermore, the regulation does not distinguish the nature of the flight, therefore all flight with aircraft above 5700 kg or authorise to carry more than 19 passengers are within the scope of the regulation.
However, if operation within European Airspace with a non-compliant aircraft after the 01/12/2015 is necessary and an upgrade to ACAS II version 7.1 has been planned, it may be possible, based on Article 71 of the Basic Regulation for an exemption to be issued for a limited duration of time. Dependent upon the aircraft registration and the authority responsible for its operations will dictate from whom the exemption has to be requested.
If the aircraft is registered in an EU member state or is registered in a third country and an EU member state is responsible for the operations, an Article 71 exemption from the national aviation authority responsible for the operation should be requested.
If the aircraft is not on a European register or a non EU state is responsible the operational approval, exemptions need to be requested from each European State in whose airspace the aircraft is  intended to be operated.
In both cases no Permit to Fly is necessary. Finally, operators should be aware that the likelihood of receiving such an exemption from each and every member state is very limited.  However, in accordance with Article 3(2) of the regulation, states shall ensure that operation of state aircraft comply with the objective of regulation, therefore states may introduce specific measures to meet these objectives.

                I voluntarily installed ACAS II V7.0 on my aircraft even it was not required to. Do I have to upgrade to ACAS II V7.1?            



 Operators that have voluntarily installed TCAS II 7.0 prior to the applicable effective dates of the Commission Regulation 1332/2011 are not affected. They do not need to upgrade their aircraft to ACAS II V7.1, but any 'new' voluntary installations must install ACAS II V7.1.

                Does EASA require us to keep current a registry of aircraft?             



 All relevant operator information, including the aircraft used for flights under the TCO authorisation, is required to be kept up-to-date during the initial application and for as long as the TCO authorisation is valid. This is normally done by the operator, using the TCO web-interface. In most circumstances, provided the information was uploaded prior to using the new aircraft, no prior approval by EASA is required for an aircraft of the same type and variant to be added to an already-authorised fleet. Should you wish to add a new aircraft type or variant (as identified by a different ICAO type designator), then prior approval from EASA must be obtained. This request needs to be submitted 30 days before the planned date of first use of the new aircraft type (TCO.315). It is at the discretion of EASA to allow selected Business Aviation operators to start operation with a new fleet without having to wait for prior approval. These operators will receive specifications for so-called “TCO Business Aircraft”, which combine aircraft of different types as long as they all meet specified criteria. Details are explained in the Annex to the TCO authorisation of the affected operators.
In general, all changes that require EASA to issue a new authorisation document or new technical specifications associated to the TCO authorisation will require prior approval by EASA.

                Can EASA issue a TCO authorisation in the absence of any aircraft compliant with the applicable standards of the Annexes to the Chicago Convention?             



 No, if an applicant for a TCO authorisation does not declare at least one aircraft compliant with all applicable technical standards of the Annexes to the Chicago Convention, EASA will not issue a TCO authorisation and will mark the aircraft as ‘Not authorised’ in the online TCO web-interface.

                My aircraft is not fitted with a reinforced cockpit door. Can I use it for flights to the EU?             



 Annex 6 to the Chicago Convention chapter 13.2.2 is fully applicable in the EU:
“From 1 November 2003, all passenger-carrying aeroplanes of a maximum certificated take-off mass in excess of 45 500 kg or with a passenger seating capacity greater than 60 shall be equipped with an approved flight crew compartment door that is designed to resist penetration by small arms fire and grenade shrapnel, and to resist forcible intrusions by unauthorised persons. This door shall be capable of being locked and unlocked from either pilot’s station”.
If your aircraft falls under the aforementioned criteria for a reinforced cockpit door but it is not equipped with one, it cannot be used for commercial air transport operations to the EU.

                Can EASA issue a TCO authorisation to an operator with open SAFA ramp inspection findings?             



 Yes. However, Commission Regulation (EU) No 452/2014 (the ‘TCO Regulation’) stipulates that the Agency shall take into account ramp inspections, as well as other recognised information on safety aspects with regards to third country operators. Open SAFA findings may indicate systemic non-compliances and warrant further focused assessments to be performed by EASA. If evidence gathered during such an assessment confirms a non-compliance with an ICAO standard, EASA may raise a separate finding under Part-TCO. This finding will need to be closed before issuance of a TCO authorisation.

                Can EASA issue a TCO authorisation in the absence of having one or more aircraft, or fleets (aircraft types), compliant with the applicable standards of the Annexes to the Chicago Convention?             



 Yes, as long as at least one aircraft is compliant with the applicable standards of the Annexes to the Chicago Convention applicable to air operators, EASA will issue a TCO authorisation. Any non-compliant aircraft and/or fleet will be marked as ‘Not authorised’ in the online TCO web-interface.

                Are there recognised industry standards or third-party audit programmes (e.g., ISO 9001, IOSA, IS-BAO, Air Charter Safety Foundation IAS, etc.) that, if accomplished, may ease the assessment process for operators requesting authorisation?             



 Conformity with industry standards (when fulfilling the requirements set out in TCO.200 and to the extent that they cover the scope defined in TCO.200(a)(1) and in the absence of safety concerns) may result in a certain bonus rating in the TCO risk-based approach. However, conformity with an industry standard does not substitute for the demonstration of compliance with specific international aviation safety (ICAO) standards by the operator, and does not replace a TCO assessment performed by EASA.

                Will Member States or EASA be responsible for the authorisation of an operator for Low Visibility Operations (LVO)?             



 When an operator receives the TCO authorisation from EASA, the authorisation is accompanied by technical specifications. These will contain the scope of the operations authorised in the EU, e.g. LVO, EDTO, PBN, DG. EASA will only authorise an operator for special operations (such as LVO) when the operator is certified for this operation by its competent aviation authority. In other words, the scope of the TCO authorisation can never exceed the scope of operations approved in the underlying AOC (Operations Specifications) issued by the competent authority of the operator.

                Is there any effect on an operator who applies for a TCO if an EASA Member State is not ICAO compliant with a specific ICAO standard (and has notified a difference accordingly)?             



 In order to be authorised, an operator must comply with all relevant ICAO standards, unless covered by either a) or b) below:
a) For reasons of equal treatment, EASA will not require compliance with those ICAO standards for which any EASA Member State has filed a difference to ICAO.
b) EASA publishes a list of standards for which mitigating measures may be accepted, provided that the State of the operator had filed a difference to ICAO. In this case, the applicant operator must demonstrate mitigating measures to EASA that provide for an equivalent level of safety to that of the international standard. For all other cases which do not fall under a) or b) the operator needs to demonstrate compliance with the international (ICAO) standard.

                With respect to the “Alternative means of Compliance” provision in TCO.105(a),  can we deviate from an ICAO standard if we submit a risk assessment to the Agency?            



 No. Alternative means of compliance cannot be used to establish compliance with ICAO standards (ref. Guidance Material GM1 TCO.105).
TCO.105 (a) solely refers to the situation where an operator intends to deviate from so called Acceptable Means of Compliance (AMC). Currently, EASA has published only three AMC provisions related to Part-TCO, namely AMC1 TCO.105(a), AMC1 TCO.200(b) and AMC1 TCO.210. If the operator is compliant with these three, then TCO.105 is not applicable.

                Which aircraft should be notified in the TCO Web Interface as part of our TCO application?             



 You should only notify aircraft listed in your AOC Operations Specifications. These aircraft must be authorised by your Civil Aviation Authority for flights to EU territories and intended to be used for operations to EU territories. To give an example, if you were an airline operating a regional turboprop fleet and a long-haul fleet, and you only intended to use your long-haul fleet to the EU, then only enter your long-haul fleet in the TCO web-interface. If your long-haul fleet consisted of sister aircraft A, B and C and you only intend to use aircraft A and B for flights to EU territories, do not notify aircraft C.
Aircraft planned to be added to your fleet in the future should not be notified to us, until they are endorsed in the Operations Specifications of your AOC. Aircraft withdrawn from operations to the EU and/or withdrawn from your fleet should be deleted in the TCO web-interface without undue delay.
You can amend the aircraft list in your Basic Operator Data (BOD) questionnaire in the TCO web-interface any time. It is important that the aircraft list is kept up-to-date at all times to avoid potential problems, e.g. during ramp inspections.

                What is the difference between the EASA TCO authorisation and an operating permit issued by an EASA member State?            



 The TCO authorisation is a safety authorisation issued by EASA following a technical assessment. This technical authorisation issued by EASA is a mandatory prerequisite when applying with any EASA Member State for commercial traffic rights (operating permits), which continue to be issued directly by Member States.

                Can you explain the steps involved in the TCO application process, beginning with how the carrier should initiate contact to apply, through to the issuance of the TCO authorisation?            



 1. The operator should follow the process published on the EASA website and submit its administrative TCO application form.
2. Once EASA has received the administrative application, the operator receives log-on credentials to the web-based TCO software application.
3. Once logged-on to the web-based TCO software application, the operator completes an electronic questionnaire and uploads specific operational documents.
4. EASA then evaluates all the submitted information and decides if a further in-depth assessment is necessary.
5. As soon as the assessment is successfully completed the operator will receive its TCO authorisation document and associated technical specifications.

                How much in advance should an application for TCO authorisation be submitted before the intended starting date of our EU operations?             



 TCO.300 (b)(1) requires the application at least 30 days before the intended starting date of operation. Therefore, it is highly recommended that you submit the application well in advance of the intended operation. This will allow for sufficient lead time as the Agency, under ART.200(b), may need to conduct a further assessment. Where EASA decides to invite operators for a meeting or to perform an on-site audit, the TCO authorisation process can take several months, especially when the technical assessment results in findings that have to be closed before EASA can issue the authorisation.

                Are approvals obtained in the field of aviation security (e.g., ACC3) considered in the TCO Authorisation process?            



 No. TCO is a flight safety (not an aviation security) assessment. To this end, TCO addresses security-related issues only to the extent that these are relevant to flight safety and part of an ICAO standard applicable to air operators pursuant to ICAO Annex 6 (e.g., CCTV, reinforced cockpit door, etc.). ACC3 is subject to a separate EU regulation that is unrelated to the TCO Regulation.

                How is the economic aspect of the approval (commercial traffic rights  - air services agreement) split from the EASA Safety oversight element?            



 EASA TCO only takes over the safety-related part of foreign operator assessment, whereas operating permits (commercial traffic rights) will continue to be issued by individual Member States. EASA does not (and cannot) issue operating permits and these remain an area of national responsibility. However, operators should be aware that in addition to other requirements, they must hold a valid TCO authorisation before a Member State can issue an operating permit.

                How will EU-OPS provisions on code-sharing interact with Part-TCO?            



 In order to comply with the code-sharing requirements of Regulation (EU) No. 965/2012, it is not enough to hold only a TCO authorisation. Because they involve EU rules as well as ICAO standards, the code-share provisions will apply in addition to the requirements of Part-TCO. Therefore, a third-country operator who shares codes with an EU carrier will be subject to both sets of requirements and their related AMC [ORO.AOC.115/ARO.OPS.105]. In practice, the third-country operator will be obliged to undergo comprehensive audits for the initial and continuous verification of compliance with the applicable ICAO Standards [AMC1 ORO.AOC.115(a)(1)]. The audits can be performed either by the EU operator itself, or by a third-party provider [AMC2 ORO.AOC.115(b)], which includes the possibility of using industry standards such as IOSA. The audit will focus on the operational, management and control systems of the TCO [AMC1 ORO.AOC.115(a)(1)]. Ensuring that the code-sharing third-country operator continues to comply with the applicable ICAO Standards, will be achieved through a code-share audit programme [AMC1 ORO.AOC.115(b)].

                Our operation is currently subject to an operating ban in accordance with the EU Air Safety List (Reg. (EC) No 2111/2005). Can we nevertheless apply for a TCO authorisation?             



 Operators who are subject to an operating ban or restriction in accordance with Reg. (EC) No 2111/2005 are eligible to apply for a TCO authorisation. The authorisation process will require that an audit be performed at the operational premises of the operator. Once EASA has finished its assessment, it will present the results to the European Commission for consideration. EASA cannot issue an authorisation until the European Commission has lifted the operating ban under the Air Safety List Regulation. Note: When the operator is subject to an operating ban due to the State of the Operator not performing adequate oversight, EASA must coordinate with the European Commission before processing the application for a TCO authorisation.

 The aircraft lessor does not need a TCO authorisation, but the third country operator (lessee) must hold a TCO authorisation. Rule of thumb: it is always the operating carrier that performs flights under its responsibility with aircraft under its AOC that needs a TCO authorisation.

                Which EU operating rules are applicable to third country operators?             



 Third country operators intending to perform commercial air transport operations (into, out or within the EU) are subject to Part-TCO. In addition, they must comply with the Standardised European Rules of the Air (SERA) and Airspace Usage Requirements (AUR). The State Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP), the Single European Sky (SES) implementing rules and in particular the Interoperability rules also apply. There are also other Regulations under the responsibility of the European Commission that need to be followed, including:

                Will the TCO authorisation cover the transport of forbidden Dangerous Goods?            



 The TCO authorisation doesn't cover the transport of forbidden DGs, but it doesn't ban these flights either, as long as they are covered by exemptions issued by each of the concerned states in accordance with paragraph 4.2 of Annex 18 to the Chicago Convention.

                For a flight requiring diplomatic clearance, does it need to be performed under a TCO authorisation?            



 An EASA safety authorisation is required by third country operators engaged in commercial air transport operations into, within or out of the territory subject to the provisions of the Treaty [of the EU]. A third country operator (TCO) in the context of a TCO authorisation is an Air Operator Certificate (AOC) holder certified in a non-EASA member State. Commercial air transport (scheduled or non-scheduled) is defined as “flights involving the transport of passengers, cargo or mail for remuneration or hire”.
As a consequence, it is EASA’s position that regardless of the nature of passengers, cargo or mail involved, a flight performed by an AOC holder for remuneration or hire with civil aircraft constitutes commercial air transport and is subject to prior TCO authorisation by EASA if the above conditions apply.
A flight may require (additional) diplomatic clearance; however, this is unrelated to the requirement of TCO authorisation where applicable.

                My principle place of business (POB) is in an EU overseas territory which is not listed in the scope of Commission Regulation (EU) No 452/2014. Do I need a TCO authorisation to fly to territories which are in the scope of Commission Regulation (EU) 452/2014 ?             



 Yes a TCO authorisation is required, if your principle place of business (POB) is in one of the following territories (i.e. an EU overseas territory which is not listed in the scope of Commission Regulation (EU) No 452/2014)
Greenland and Faroe Islands

                Is a TCO authorisation required by Business Aviation Operators?            



 It depends. If you perform commercial air transport under an Air Operator Certificate (AOC) (operating aircraft for hire to transport passengers, cargo or mail) the answer is yes. If you file flight plans using the flight types “N” or “S” then you are conducting commercial air transport operations and must hold a TCO authorisation issued by EASA in order to operate to EU territories.

 U.S. 14 CFR Part 125 Operators are not eligible to apply for a TCO Authorisation. An FAA Part 125 Operating Certificate is not an Air Operator Certificate (AOC) as defined in ICAO Annex 6, Part I. An ICAO-compliant AOC is required for commercial air transport operations to EU territories. United States 14 CFR Part 125 Operators may conduct non-commercial, general aviation flights to EU territories in line with provisions stipulated in the AIP of the State of destination. Make sure the type of flight is correctly denoted in item no. 8 of the ATS flight plan (‘G’ for general aviation).

                What is a one-off notification?            



 Article 3 of the so-called TCO regulation requires all third country operators engaging in commercial air transport operations to EASA Member States to hold an authorisation issued by the Agency.
One-off notification is referring to article TCO.305 “Non-scheduled Flights – one-off notification“ of the TCO regulation.
This article provides a way to derogate from Article 3 in order to perform air ambulance flights or a non-scheduled flight or a series of non-scheduled flights to overcome an unforeseen, immediate and urgent operational need without first obtaining an authorisation issued by the Agency.

 The dedicated application form may be found here.
The filled form together with the requested supporting documents must be submitted by the Agency via the dedicated ‘one-off’ email address.
Upon receipt of the application form and the supporting documents, EASA will send the applicant an automated acknowledgment email. The received acknowledgment email will serve as a proof that EASA has received a ‘one-off notification’ application. This acknowledgement may be used temporarily by operators, in conjunction with the application form and the submitted documents, to support their request for operating permits from the concerned EU Member States.

 The concerned EU Member State will review the application form and the submitted documents in order to evaluate and decide on the request for the operating permits. In case of a refusal, the EU Member State will inform the Agency accordingly.
The Agency will also review the received application form and the supporting documentation. Should this review be unsatisfactory (e.g. no valid Air Operator Certificate, operations are requested that are not approved on the operations specifications documents, false declaration, etc.) the Agency will immediately remove the privileges given under the ‘One-off notification’ and inform the Member States.

                    Initial Airworthiness                  




        
            
                Can "Field Loadable Software" be delivered with an EASA Form 1 and is an EASA Form 1 required for installation?            



 First of all it should be clear that the definition of "parts and appliances" (Refer to article 3 of the Basic Regulation) includes software. This is software that is installed in an aircraft and used in operating or controlling that aircraft. The rest of this response only refers to this type of software.
Secondly, "Subpart K - Parts and appliances" from Part-21 addressing installation, approval and release is applicable to this software and therefore:
this software must be part of the design data; and
the installation of this software in a type-certified aircraft is only accepted when it is accompanied by an EASA Form 1 and properly marked; and
the installation is approved. (Refer to 21A.303).
In order to achieve 1) and 2), the organisation that manufactures and releases the software must meet the requirements of Subpart F or G from Part-21. This means in particular that the software must be part of the scope of that production organisation and there must be a link between the design organisation and the production organisation.
The conclusion for Field Loadable Software is therefore that this software can be delivered with an EASA Form 1 when:
it is part of design data for which approval has been applied or granted; and.
it is produced by, and within the scope of a production organisation that meets the requirements of Subpart F or G.
Marking of this Field Loadable Software must be in accordance with Subpart Q of Part-21. For practical reasons the marking could be on the software "container" (e.g. the CD carrying the software).

                What is the definition of "Critical parts"?            



 The term "critical part" or "critical component" is used in various EASA requirements, certification specifications and also in the EU-US bilateral, however it is not always defined. 
	A general definition does not exist. There are currently basically three different definitions:
for rotorcraft: 
		CS 27-29-VLR.602(a): A critical part is a part, the failure of which could have a catastrophic effect upon the rotorcraft, and for which critical characteristics have been identified which must be controlled to ensure the required level of integrity. 
		 
for engines, propellers and APUs: 
		CS-E.510(c) It is recognised that the probability of Primary Failures of certain single elements cannot be sensibly estimated in numerical terms. If the Failure of such elements is likely to result in Hazardous Engine Effects, reliance must be placed on meeting the prescribed integrity specifications of CS-E 515 (Engine critical parts) in order to support the objective of an Extremely Remote probability of Failure. 
		(similar for CS-P.150(c) and CS-P.160 and also for CS-APU.210(c) and CS-APU.150)
		 
in the EU-US bilateral: 
		A "Critical component" means a part identified as critical by the design approval holder during the product type validation process, or otherwise by the exporting authority. Typically, such components include parts for which a replacement time, inspection interval, or related procedure is specified in the Airworthiness Limitations section or certification maintenance requirements of the manufacturer's maintenance manual or Instructions for Continued Airworthiness. 
		 
Each of the above definitions should be used only within their own context and for their own purpose i.e. the definition of the bilateral is only relevant for the automatic acceptance of PMA parts and repair design from the US. Where the term "critical part" is not defined the dictionary meaning of "critical" should be used i.e. crucial, decisive, important, etc. 
	For the application of Part 21A.805 critical parts are those identified as such by the design approval holder, which for rotorcraft, engines, propellers and APUs as a minimum should be those using the definitions of the relevant CS.

                What is the mandate of the Agency for Environmental issues? What does the Agency concretely do?            



 Article 6 of the Basic Regulation transposes into Community law the International standards of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) related to the environmental certification of aeronautical products. The Agency is involved, together with the Commission, in the further development of such standards to ensure that they do take into account Community objectives in this field. Another important task of the Agency is to verify that the design of products comply with environmental requirements. The Agency shall therefore establish and notify the appropriate environmental requirements for each product for which environmental certification is required and issue the appropriate environmental certificates.
Such powers are established by articles 20(d) and (h) respectively of the Basic Regulation and further detailed in Part 21.A.18 "Designation of applicable environmental protection requirements and certification specifications" of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1702/2003.

                Design Approval: FAA Supplementary Type Certificates (STC) approved by National Aviation Authorities (NAAs) before 28-09-03 are deemed to be approved by EASA. If the NAA has limited the approval in scope compared to the original FAA STC such that it does not cover all the models, how can we apply for an extension of the scope?            



 Because Agency ED Decision 2004/04/CF automatically approves minor changes and major level 2 changes to FAA STCs when made by the STC holder on his own STC, the scope of the EASA STC is considered to be the same as the scope of the original FAA STC. Therefore there is no need for an application and the STC can be applied to all models listed on the FAA STC.

                Why and how must Parts and Appliances be marked, when are the letters EPA required, and which exceptions are acceptable?            



 To comply with EASA Part-21, Subpart D, 21.A.109, Subpart E, 21A.118A (b) and Subpart M, 21A.451(a) and (b), it is the obligation of the respective Holders of a Minor Change Approval, a STC, or a Major Repair Design Approval, to specify the required markings, including EPA letters as applicable, in their Design (read, ‘Approved Data’), according EASA Part-21, Subpart Q.
Subpart Q, 21.A.804(a), and related GM, require proper identification of each Part and Appliance that is designed or redesigned, including parts designed to be incorporated in repairs (21A.451), by ‘permanent and legible marking’ hereof, and is applicable for Design Organisations and Manufacturers.
21.A.804(a) 1 and 2  clearly require marking of Parts and Appliances with ‘name, trademark, or symbol identifying the Manufacturer’ and ‘Part number’, as defined in the applicable Design Data.
According to the GM the Design Approval Holder shall identify in all its Design (TC, STC, ETSO, Repair, Change) approved after 28 December 2009, how the Manufacturer has to mark subject Parts and Appliances in accordance with 21A.804(a) 1; which can be limited to identifying a marking field and the method, without prescribing the actual text or symbols.
21.A.804(a) 3 requires additionally marking with the letters ‘EPA’ of all parts produced (manufactured) in accordance with data ‘not belonging to the TC holder of the related product’.
Each interchangeable or removable Part or Appliance that is manufactured in accordance with a design issued by the Design Organisation, shall be permanently and legibly marked according to 21.A.804. The EPA marking was introduced in 2004; this was done to clearly identify any ‘not original’ Part, (which means any Part or Appliance not designed by the TC- or ETSO- Approval Holder), as a trigger for Maintenance Organisations and Accident or Incident investigators, in the light of Continuing Airworthiness. The intention was certainly not to require adding of the letters ‘EPA’ to mark repairs. In this context, EPA marking only applies to the new designed and manufactured parts to be incorporated in the repair. Especially where repairs have an impact on interchangeability, identification of incorporated new Parts is very important, and DO Procedures should address this item.
The only accepted exception with regard to Marking (including EPA), is defined in 21.A.804(b). This subparagraph offers the possibility to not physically mark the Part of Appliance, when it is too small or when marking hereof is otherwise impractical, but only after “Agency agreement”. This wording allows an Applicant/Holder of a Design and the Agency to further define in detail how this ‘agreement’ can be obtained and will be formalised. DOATL should however ensure that the DOA Applicant/Holder reflects this approach in its DO Handbook or Procedures, requiring at least a justification of the reason for not marking physically, and details of the alternative way chosen for the identification, in accordance with 21A.804(b), to know on the authorised release document accompanying the Part or Appliance, or on its container.

                Can manufacturers of raw materials obtain a Production Organisation Approval (POA) under Part 21 Subpart G? (19/11/2004)            



 The Agency has concluded after a thorough review that the current Basic Regulation and Part 21 do not provide for the approval of manufacturers of raw materials. Only organisations responsible for the manufacturing and subsequent release of a 'product' and 'parts and appliances' as defined in the Basic Regulation Article 3 (c) and (d) are required to hold a POA and are therefore eligible to apply for such an approval. ED Decision 2007/012/R introduced an amendment to AMC/GM to Part-21 bringing all AMC and GM to Part 21 back into line with the EC Regulations regarding this issue and thus removing any ambiguity.

 A Part 145 approved organisation can only fabricate parts for its own use in accordance with approved design data (145.A.42(c)). If that data comes from the Type Certificate holder; 21A.804(a)(3) would not be applicable and those parts will not need EPA marking. If the data comes from a Supplemental Type Certificate holder, minor change approval holder or repair approval holder, the parts will have to be marked as prescribed in the applicable data which should include an EPA marking since 28/3/2004.

                EASA STC’s being presented for approval when the pre-mod configuration is not EASA approved. What are EASA changes embedded in Non-EASA approved design?            



 21.A.101 and 21.A.103 require that the changed product meets the applicable certification basis. Therefore the change for which EASA has received an application needs to be demonstrated compliant to the EASA certification basis on product level. It is not sufficient to demonstrate compliance on change level only.
The change, applied for EASA approval, must include all affected parts of the non-approved change that builds the interface to the EASA approved product and all affected compliance demonstration (influences on the product and the non-approved interface change).
A limitation is likely to be necessary that the STC cannot be installed on an EASA registered product as long as the interface change is not yet EASA approved.

                    Basic Regulation                  




        
            
                What does the EASA Basic Regulation apply to?  How many extensions of the scope have there been?            



 The initial EASA Basic Regulation - Regulation (EC) No 1592/2002 of 15 July 2002 – included airworthiness and environmental protection of products, parts and appliances in the scope of European Union competence. It made the Agency responsible for the airworthiness and environmental certification of all aeronautical products, parts, and appliances designed, manufactured, maintained or used by persons under the regulatory oversight of EU Member States. Furthermore, the Agency was put in charge of the oversight of EU organisations involved in the design of aeronautical products, parts and appliances as well as of non-EU organisations involved in the manufacture or maintenance of such products. In these domains the Agency took over the certification tasks that were under the responsibility of Member States.
Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 February 2008 extended the scope of Union competence to air operations, flight crew licenses and aircraft used by third country operators into, within or out of the Community. It also gave the Agency additional operational responsibilities. In the field of flight crew licensing, the Agency was made responsible for the approval and oversight of pilot training organisations and aero-medical centers located outside the territory of the Community; the certification of flight simulation training devices used by the training organisations it certifies, or located outside the territory of the Community, or located in the Community territory, if the member State concerned so requests. In the field of operations, the Agency was given the power to determine corrective actions and disseminate information to react without undue delay to a problem affecting the safety of air operations. Regarding third country operators, the Agency is competent for the authorisation and oversight of commercial operators; for the oversight of non-commercial operators, when they need to declare their activities; and for the authorisation of third country aircraft when they or their crews do not comply with ICAO Standards.
The scope of EU law and the Agency’ responsibilities were further extended by Regulation (EC) No 1108/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009. The provisions of the Regulation are the basis for precise, uniform and binding rules for aerodrome operations and operators, air traffic management and air navigation service provision. With the extension to ATM/ANS, the Agency was empowered to take the necessary measures related to certification and oversight of Pan-European and third country ATM/ANS organisations, as well as for the air traffic controllers’ training organisations located outside the territory of the Community.
The entry into force of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council on 11 of September 2018 consolidated the scope of European Union competence to cover the full spectrum of the aviation landscape and reinforce the European aviation system as a whole.
The Basic Regulation now applies to all unmanned aircraft irrespective of their operating mass. The only exception are certain small tethered aircraft in Annex I of the Basic Regulation which will remain under national competence.
The Basic Regulation was also extended to ground handling services. 
The Basic Regulation also explicitly includes the design of airspace structures – which is not considered as a service but a specific Member State function. 
The Basic Regulation continues not to apply to aircraft while carrying out military, customs, police, search and rescue, firefighting, border control, coastguard or similar activities or services, nor to several aircraft mentioned in Annex I to the Basic Regulation. 
However, a novelty of the new Basic Regulation is the introduction of the possibility for chnages in scope due to the operation of several opt-in and opt-out possibilities.

                What is the scope of the Basic Regulation regarding aerodromes foreseen under Article 2(1)(e)?             



 The definition of which aerodromes are included is slightly changed in relation to the previous regulation. The requirements for aerodromes to be open to public use and serve commercial air transport remain the same. But the remaining criteria have slightly changed. 
	The new Basic Regulation applies to the design, maintenance and operations of aerodromes - and the safety related aerodrome equipment used thereon – that:
are open to public use;
serve commercial air transport; and: 
have a paved instrument runway of 800 m or more, or exclusively serve helicopters using instrument approach and departure procedures.

                What are Opt-ins and Opt-outs?            



 Opt-in and Opt-out are ways to refer to certain provisions in the new Basic Regulation (NBR) that allow for flexibility in its scope. An Opt-in refers to a situation where a product or activity there would normally be excluded becomes subject to the scope of the Regulation; the opposite case is referred to as an opt-out. 
	The new Basic Regulation provides for 2 Opt-in and 2 Opt-out possibilities.
Opt-in for state operations/aircraft (article 2(6) NBR).
This opt-in allows Member States (MS) to decide to apply EASA rules to activities that are normally excluded by article 2(3)(a) NBR – military, customs, police, search and rescue, firefighting, border control, coastguard or similar activities or services. 
Opt-in for Annex II aircraft (article 2(4) NBR).
This opt-in allows a design organization to choose to have the design, production and maintenance of a new product to be subject to EASA rules, when that product would normally be excluded from the scope of the NBR through article 2(3)(d).   
Opt-out for light aircraft (article 2(8) NBR).
This opt-out allows MS to decide to exclude certain manned light aircraft from the scope of the EASA system, making them subject to their national rules. The opt-out will not create obligations for other MS.
Opt-out for ‘small’ aerodromes (article 2(7) NBR).
This opt-out allows MS to decide to exempt the design, maintenance and operations of certain aerodromes from the EASA rules, when that aerodrome handles no more then than 10 000 commercial air transport passengers and 850 cargo operations per year.

                Does the opt-in possibility for Annex I aircraft referred to in Article 2(4) apply also to air operations and air crew licensing?             



 The opt-in in Article 2(4) does not cover air operations and air crew, but only design, production and maintenance of the aircraft concerned. So for aircraft to which this opt-in applies, the Basic Regulation will apply to airworthiness (design, production, maintenance), but for the air operations and licensing areas the aircraft will remain excluded from the scope of the Regulation, meaning that national rules will apply.   So the situation would be as under the initial Basic Regulation (Regulation (EC) 1592/2002), where the rules were harmonised in the airworthiness field but air operations and air crew licencing remained under the national competence (without mutual recognition).

                What is the opt-in for state operations/ aircraft? What is the opt-in for military aircraft?            



 One of novelties introduced by the new Basic Regulation is the possibility for member States to decide to apply the Basic Regulation to aircraft performing State activities (military, police, coast guard, firefighting, search and rescue and other similar operations and services), which would normally be subject to national rules. 
The main advantage of the opt-in is that once the aircraft are in the EASA system, they would benefit from mutual recognition of certificates, and therefore move more freely within the EU, enjoy international recognition, and increase their market value.
In relation to this opt-in, the important elements to highlight are its voluntary and modular nature - the decision to apply the BR, and the extent to which it is applied remains in the hands of the Member States. This means that the opt-in does not need to extend to the full EASA system system (from airworthiness, maintenance and production to OPS and licensing) nor to the full range of State operations under the responsibility of the Member States:
A Member State may decide to opt-in for police operations, but not for search and rescue; 
Equally, the Member States may decide to opt-in for a certain category/type of aircraft and not for others (eg, opt-in for rotorcraft but not for fixed wing); 
Finally, a Member State may decide to opt-in for one area of the EASA system and not for others (e.g. opt-in for the airworthiness of the aircraft but not for the operations). 
It is important to highlight in relation to modular opt-ins (for instance restricted to airworthiness or OPS/licensing) that within each area the opt-in has to be complete – it is not possible to opt-in for initial airworthiness but not for the continued airworthiness/maintenance of the aircraft, for example. Another important element to highlight is that in certain cases there will be the need for specific measures to address risks created by the disconnection from the total system approach – e.g. if a Member State opts-in for the airworthiness/maintenance but not for the operations, appropriate measures need to be put in place to ensure the continued airworthiness of the aircraft. 
Due to this modularity, each opt-in case will be different from the next, and requires an individual approach.
The Basic Regulation establishes only one condition for the opt-in, which is that the provisions covered by the opt-in can be effectively applied. The formalities needed to implement the opt-in are simple:
The Member State needs to issue a decision; from the date of that decision, the opt-in applies immediately;
The Member State then notifies this decision to the Commission and the Agency, together with relevant information;
The Commission, after consulting the Agency, establishes whether the condition for the opt-in is fulfilled. If it is not, then the Commission issues a decision. Once notified, the Member State needs to modify or revoke its decision.

                In the context of the exclusion of some operations from the scope of the Basic Regulation - such as military, police, coast guard and search and rescue operations - how to interpret the sentence in Article 2(3)(a) “similar activities or services under the control and responsibility of a Member State, undertaken in the public interest by or on behalf of a body vested with the powers of a public authority”?              



 The purpose of this sentence is to extend the exclusion of the application of the Basic Regulation to other type of operations not specially mentioned in Article 2(6), but that share some of the same characteristics. Looking at the operations that are specifically mentioned (military, coast guard, search and rescue, etc), they have in common the fact that they are performed in the service of public interest – which may sometimes require the operators to assume different levels of risk than those foreseen in the Basic regulation for normal civil operations.
	The Basic Regulation clarifies that such activities and services should be carried out “under the control and responsibility of Member State and undertaken in the public interest by or on behalf of a body vested with public authority powers (Article 2(3)(a)). The Regulation does not further define the terms “under the control and responsibility of MS and “undertaken in the public interest” – this leaves the responsibility for determining whether a certain activity falls within the scope of the Basic Regulation, in the hands of the Member States, as part of their general duty to implement EU Law. The Agency will monitor the exercise of this responsibility by the Member States as part of its standardisation responsibilities under the Basic Regulation.
	In our view the different wording only clarifies already existing practice and should not change substantially the approach towards state services/activities.

                What are the differences between an implementing act and a delegated act? Have any delegated acts been adopted?            



 The Lisbon Treaty makes a distinction between two sets of Commission implementing rules – implementing acts (IA) and delegated acts (DA). Delegated and implementing acts are subject to different procedures for their adoption. More information on these two types of act can be found in the European Commission’s website (https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-making-process/adopting-eu-law/implementing-and-delegated-acts_en#documents).  
No delegated acts are yet adopted under the EASA Basic Regulation, since these two different types of implementing rules were only introduced by the latest Basic Regulation (2018/1139). However, the Commission has adopted delegated acts in other domains, so it that respect, it is nothing new.
It is also important to highlight that this difference in procedure for the adoption of DA and IA at Commission level does not affect the EASA rulemaking procedure, which will remain the same regardless of the type of act that will in the end be adopted.

                What will happen with the exemptions granted by Member States under Regulation (EC) 216/2008 Article 4(3b)?            



 Exemptions granted under Regulations 216/2008 will remain valid according to article 2(7) and supported by recital 8. 
The Basic Regulation requires Member States to notify the Commission and the Agency the exemptions previously granted under Article 4(3b) of Regulation 216/2008 to ensure transparency and legal certainty – this is merely informative, no additional assessment against the requirements of the new BR is required.
Under Regulation 2019/1139 Member States can continue to exempt certain aerodromes from the scope of the Regulation, however now Member States must follow stricter requirements – in order to grant an exemption, they need to ensure that the exemption does not endanger compliance with the essential requirements.

                Which kind of measures can the Commission apply against the National aviation authorities who do not comply with their obligations deriving from Regulation (EU) No 2018/1139 and of the delegated and implementing acts?             



 The implementation of the Basic Regulation and its implementing rules by Member States is subject to the European Union oversight. According to Article 85 of the Basic Regulation - Monitoring of Member States - the Agency shall assist the Commission in monitoring such implementation by conducting standardisation inspections and monitoring activities. Upon the standardisation inspection the Agency establishes an inspection report where it addresses findings identified during the inspection and which will be sent to the Member State concerned and to the Commission. In cases of non-compliance, the Commission may initiate an infringement procedure.
Additionally, in accordance with Article 67, the Commission, on its own initiative or at the request of a Member State or the Agency, may initiate a comitology procedure to decide whether a certificate issued or declaration made in accordance with the Basic Regulation or of delegated and implementing acts adopted on the basis thereof, effectively complies with them. In case of non-compliance, the Commission shall require, based on a recommendation of EASA, the Member State responsible of the oversight of a certificate to take appropriate corrective action, such as limitation or suspension of that certificate. Moreover, once the Commission issues such a decision, the obligation of mutual recognition of certificates ceases to apply to the other Member States. Once the Commission has sufficient evidence that appropriate corrective action has been taken, it will decide that mutual recognition shall be restored.
The oversight support mechanism in Article 66 is a new mechanism foreseen in the Basic Regulation meant to deal with situations where the Member State has shown a serious and persisting failure in complying with the safety provisions; in other words, it is a tool to react to immediate safety concerns. Article 66 of the Basic Regulation provides that in certain cases and only when the conditions described in the article the Commission can request the Member State concerned and EASA to establish jointly a temporary technical assistance programme, where the Agency would help the Member State to restore the acceptable level of safety. In accordance to Article 66 (2), during the oversight support programme, the Member State and the Agency would work together and the operations in the affected Member State can continue while the deficiencies are corrected, hence no negative impact to the aviation industry in the concerned Member State. 
It is also important to note, that differently to Articles 64 and 65 of the new Basic Regulation, the support mechanism does not result in reallocation of responsibilities for the tasks related to certification, oversight and enforcement. This means that even during the oversight support programme, the Member State concerned remains responsible for its tasks, Article 66 (2).  
While the Commission has a power to request that the Member State concerned and EASA establish an oversight support programme and the Member State concerned should make all possible efforts to restore its ability to perform its tasks, the article also provides a Member State a possibility to step out from the programme. If the Member State concerned recognises that the programme cannot be successfully implemented as planned, it should inform the Commission, and either reallocate responsibility for the certification, oversight and enforcement tasks to which the deficiencies pertain to the Agency or another Member State, or take other measures to resolve the deficiencies (Article 66(4).

 The competences to be gained at the end of the practical instructional techniques course for the OJTI or STDI endorsement are the same (see AMC2 ATCO.D.090(a)(1)), but there may be differences in the assessment (see AMC1 ATCO.D.090(a)(3)) and there may also be natural differences between the courses themselves based on the applicants they are addressing.

                Can a Member State accept an ATCO license issued in accordance with the laws of a third country?            



 In accordance with Article 68 of Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 (Basic Regulation) national competent authorities may accept certificates issued in accordance with laws of a third country only where such possibility is provided for in: (a) international agreement concerning recognition of certificates concluded between the Union and a third country, (b) a delegated act adopted by the Commission, or (c) in absence of the recognition agreement concluded by the EU and of the relevant delegated acts, also on the basis of an international agreement concluded by a Member State with a third country before the entry into force of the former EASA basic regulation and notified to the Commission.

                Why is there a difference in the requirements on the responsibility for undertaking  assessment of previous competence in ATCO.B.010(b) compared with ATCO.B.001(d) and ATCO.B.005(e) and how should the difference be interpreted? Some say that the assessment could be conducted by a unit training organisation, while others are of the opinion that the assessment and if needed, additional rating training is to be done by an initial training organisation.            



 The purpose of not referring to initial training organisations in ATCO.B.010(b) is to leave some flexibility and to allow the possibility also for a unit training organisation to perform the assessment. Recognising that in most cases an initial training organisation would be in best position to perform the assessment of previous competence, it needs to be taken into consideration that training for rating endorsements is often conducted by unit training organisations. As the privileges of the rating endorsements are associated with the rating in question, the unit training organisation could also be suited to evaluate the previous competence. In any case, in accordance with AMC1 ATCO.B.010(b) the assessment should be based on the requirements set out in Part ATCO, subpart D, Sections 2 (initial training requirements).
Having considered the above mentioned, the competent authority should evaluate, which  training organisation under its supervision is eligible to perform the assessment of previous competence taking into account amongst others the requirements of AMC1 ATCO.B.010(b).
The result of the assessment of previous competence may evidence that there is a need for a training ‘course’ to recuperate an adequate level of skills to enable the applicant starting unit training. In this case, it is up to the Training Organisation performing the assessment to decide what the training needs are depending on the results of the assessment of previous competence. This may also include Initial Training, if the gaps identified so require.

                Do STDI instructors need a valid English language endorsement in their licences to obtain and to exercise their privileges?            



 The language endorsement requirement concerns also STDIs. The rationale is that an ATCO licence holder shall not exercise the privileges of the licences unless he/she has a valid language proficiency endorsement and exercising the privilege of the STDI endorsement is seen as exercising the privileges of the licence.

                Regulation 805/2011 requires one or more rating endorsements, including TCL and OCN, to be added to an ACS rating.  However, Regulation 2015/340 does not appear to allow for both the TCL and OCN ratings to be added to an ACS rating at the same time.            



 EASA acknowledges that both TCL and OCN rating endorsements could be associated to the ACS rating at the same time. As this amendment will require a change to the IR, EASA will address it with its next Opinion to EC resulting from rulemaking activities on ‘Maintaining of ATCO IR/AMC/GM’.

                If an assessors is assessed medically unfit, is he/she is allowed to perform or conduct assessments?            



 EASA acknowledges that assessors are only required to possess a valid medical certificate, when they exercise the privileges of the assessor endorsement as described in ATCO.C.045(b)(3) and (4), i.e. performing assessments leading to the issue, revalidation and renewal of unit endorsements.  He/she could still carry out assessments as in the cases specified in  ATCO.C.045 (b)(1), (2) and (5), i.e. assessment related to initial training and to the issue of OJTI/STDI and assessor endorsements (provided that he/she has the required experience).
Furthermore, in reference to the introductory part of Appendix 1 to Annex II ‘Format for licence - AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER LICENCE’, paragraph (b) that states "The licence shall be accompanied by a valid medical certificate, except when only STDI privileges are exercised", EASA acknowledges that it needs to be aligned, which privileges require the existence of a valid medical certificate and it will be addressed with EASA next Opinion to EC resulting from rulemaking activities on ‘Maintaining of ATCO IR/AMC/GM’.

 The conversion training courses shall include the determination of the examination and/or assessment methods. The examination and/or assessment should take place during the conversion training course or at least before the ATCOs exercise the privileges of their licences in the changed operational environment. Examinations and assessments should be conducted by appropriately qualified personnel having detailed knowledge of the training objectives and the subjects, topics and subtopics being examined or assessed.

                Should an STDI endorsement be issued for an OJTI who is no longer competent? In such case, is there a possibility for a temporary issue of the STDI endorsement or can the OJTI endorsement be retained on the licence if it is anticipated that the OJTI would regain competency?            



 
ATCO.C.010 states that the OJTI endorsement entitles the person to also exercise the privileges of an STDI endorsement (that is, to provide practical training on Synthetic Training Devices (STDs)). Thus, there is no need to introduce both endorsements simultaneously into the licence during the validity of the OJTI endorsement. Once the OJTI endorsement cannot be exercised, it can be exchanged into an STDI endorsement, for which the validity date shall correspond to the validity date of the original OJTI endorsement, until its next revalidation.

                What should be assessed and/or examined in relation to refresher training? When are the assessments/examinations to take place and who can conduct the assessments?            



 ATCO.B.025(a)(5) and (7) require the air navigation service provider as part of the UCS to define processes for assessing competence, including assessment of the refresher training subjects according to ATCO.D.080(b) and to define the processes to identify the topics, subtopics and training methods for continuation training (including refresher training).
ATCO.D.080(c) stipulates that when subjects of refresher training refresh the skills of ATCOs, performance objectives have to be established and included in the training syllabus.
In this context, GM1 ATCO.D.080 further clarifies that ‘refresher training subjects may include rarely used procedures and practices, such as seasonally dependent procedures, trends and observations from occurrence reports and results from normal operation surveys’. Consequently, the use of STD or other simulated environments in this case would allow for the assessment of these procedures and practices, at any time and with the desired effect.
In accordance with AMC1 ATCO.B.025(a)(5);(6), subjects taught during refresher training, such as standard practices and procedures, abnormal and emergency situations and human factors, should be assessed on STD or in other simulated environments and/or examined. This is because it might not be possible to observe the skills related to all refresher training subjects (e.g. those related to seasonally dependent procedures) during the regular assessment.
Assessments are required on subjects that are of practical nature, while other subjects should be examined. When defining the need for assessment and/or examination, attention should be paid on the training objectives (what is the required performance/taxonomy level) and the processes and method for assessment/examination.
It is left to the Training Organisation, in coordination with the Air Navigation Service Provider, to decide and to arrange for the assessment of refresher training subjects in the context of the ‘regular’ assessment purposed for the revalidation of the unit endorsement. In this case, a clear link between the refresher training subjects and the performance objectives of the assessment needs to be established.
If the assessment of refresher training subjects is taking place during the assessment leading to the revalidation of the unit endorsement, the person conducting the assessment shall be a holder of an assessor endorsement. Should the assessment take place during the refresher training course, the assessments should be conducted by appropriately qualified personnel having detailed knowledge of the training objectives and the subjects, topics and subtopics being examined or assessed. It could be either assessors or e.g. human factors specialists.
In case that the Training Organisation certified for refresher training does not hold a certificate for ATC provision, the processes for assessment and examination should be addressed in the specific agreement concluded between the Training Organisation and the an ANSP.

                How should the pages and the information in Item XIIa ‘Rating and endorsements with expiry date’ be arranged within the ATCO licence format?             



 Item XIIa ‘Ratings and endorsements with expiry dates’ could be arranged in two ways:
either by 1 table in landscape orientation – using 2 pages of 1/8 A4 (e.g. Pages 5 and 6); or
by 2 tables in portrait orientation – each of them rotated with the respective heading (e.g. Pages 5 and 6).

                How should ratings and rating endorsements be linked together in the proposed licence format? There are two rating endorsements (Terminal Control (TCL) and Oceanic Control (OCN)) that can be attached either to the Approach Control Surveillance (APS) or the Area Control Surveillance (ACS) rating. The licence template establishes in point IX a place for ratings and another one for rating endorsements, with no link between these two. The question is how to differentiate between the two: to which rating (APS or ACS) corresponds each one of those rating endorsements (TCL or OCN)? Is it necessary at all to make the distinction?            



 The ‘pairing’ of the current rating(s) and rating endorsement(s) is visible in point XIIa, which lists the ratings and rating endorsements according to the unit endorsements. Apart from that, there is no need to distinguish further.

                ATCOs who already hold a licence with an on-the-job training instructor (OJTI) endorsement according to Regulation (EU) No 805/2011, could they have their licence replaced to include the synthetic training device instructor (STDI) endorsement, with the same expiry dates?            



 ATCO.C.010 states that the OJTI endorsement entitles the person to also exercise the privileges of an STDI endorsement (that is, to provide practical training on Synthetic Training Devices (STDs). Thus, there is no need to introduce both endorsements simultaneously into the same licence, until the OJTI is valid. Once the OJTI endorsement cannot be exercised anymore, it can be exchanged into an STDI endorsement whose validity date shall correspond to the validity date of the original OJTI endorsement, until its next revalidation.

                Is the same ‘practical instructional techniques course’ valid for obtaining/revalidating the OJTI/STDI licence endorsements?            



 The competences to be gained at the end of the practical instructional techniques course for the OJTI or STDI endorsement are the same (see AMC2 ATCO.D.090(a)(1)), but there may be differences in the assessment (see AMC1 ATCO.D.090(a)(3)) and there may also be natural differences between the courses themselves based on the applicants they are addressing.

 If the practical instructor was holding an OJTI endorsement, it can be exchanged for an STDI endorsement. If the practical instructor was holding an STDI endorsement though, there is no need for exchange.

                How to issue a licence with STDI privileges for applicants not holding a licence and associated ratings issued in accordance with Regulation (EU) No 805/2011?            



 If the ratings are issued in accordance with Directive 2006/23/EC, they are ‘grandfathered’. Thus, a licence with an STDI endorsement could be issued to applicants who fulfil the provisions of ATCO.C.035. In order to exercise the privileges of the STDI endorsement, the holder has to demonstrate compliance with ATCO.C.030(b) including demonstrated knowledge of current operational practices.
If the ratings are issued earlier than the Directive, the competent authority would need to assess the equivalence between the old (ICAO?) ratings and the current ones. In the case where the applicant has not held a licence (because there were no licences in the Member State in question), the applicant would need to provide evidence for the working experience in the ATC domain in question and related training records to the competent authority, which would need to evaluate whether the applicant fulfils the requirements of ATCO.C.035.

                Is there a requirement for an ATCO who holds an ACS rating to also hold an ACP rating?            



 No, there is no such explicit requirement in the Regulation. This depends on the service provided. If Air Traffic Control (ATC) is only provided with the use of surveillance equipment, there is no need for the ATCO to also hold the procedural rating, e.g. for applying vertical separation in emergency situations, this should be part of the ACS training. If the contingency plans also include procedures for service continuity by means of providing (limited) procedural ATC, a procedural rating should be required. It also needs to be taken into account what applies for the maintenance and revalidation of the unit endorsement.

                It was explained at the ATCO Regulation Workshop in March 2015 that in the event of surveillance failure which results in having to switch to a procedural environment, once the failure is contained and the environment made safe, the provision of any further service would require an Approach Control Procedural (APP) or an Area Control Procedural (ACP) rating. What about if the unit or sector, operated in a rigid environment of 1 departure every 10 minutes, is to be handed over to a surveillance unit/sector and with no other traffic involved, would this be considered a requirement for the procedural rating?            



 As a rule of thumb, the provision of procedural ATC requires a procedural rating. It should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, e.g. whether procedural separation/clearances/procedures would be used.

                The removal of the age limit from an ATCO licence is a difference against the ICAO Standards And Recommended Practices (SARPs). Are Member States required to file a difference to ICAO or has EASA already notified ICAO on behalf of Member States?            



 Filing of differences falls within the competence of the Member States, since EASA (or the EU) is not an ICAO member. EASA, however, prepares the Compliance Checklist for ICAO Annex 1 in relation to Regulation (EU) 2015/340, which will be communicated to the Member States via the network of the European National Continuous Monitoring Coordinators.

                Initial Training Centre Assessors will be granted ‘grandfather rights’, according to Regulation (EU) 2015/340, with regard to the assessor endorsement. Shall this assessor privilege be endorsed on their licence?            



 Such privileges are not automatically ‘grandfathered’. It is up to the evaluation of the Member State how to convert the privileges of personnel acting as examiners or assessors for initial training (according to Regulation (EU) No 805/2011) into an assessor endorsement (according to Regulation (EU) 2015/340). Based on that evaluation, Member States may establish conversion requirements for this personnel in order to be issued with an assessor endorsement. The conversion shall be performed in accordance with the opt-out derogations.

                Appendix 1 of Annex 2 is quite prescriptive as regards the content of the licence. It indicates that each page pf the licence shall be one-eighth A4 (first quality paper). Do we need to identify all the pages with numbers and do they all belong to the same piece of paper? For the optional item V (holder’s address), should we decide not to ask for it, can we delete line V from the licence?            



 The licence should ideally be one piece of paper of six pages (including the list of abbreviations). In this case, there is no need to identify the pages with numbers as the identification is done by the numbers of the columns (items). If the licence is printed on separate pages, the licence number and the date of issue, as well as page numbers, should be printed on each page. Item V (holder’s address) can be left empty, or it can be omitted from the licence, while still maintaining the layout of page 2.

                Is it acceptable to have a licence with electronic elements, with the possibility for the ATCO to get the data via the Internet or by connecting the licence to a computer? Is a credit card format acceptable? If yes, can we have on the recto of the card the elements of page one, an on the verso the items of page 2? Is it compulsory to have all the permanent items displayed on the plastic card? Are there any EASA requirements for the font type and size, as well as the size of the card? For the signature of the holder, is it acceptable to use the signature on the application form and duplicate it on the licence (credit card format)?            



 The licence format, as set out in Regulation (EU) 2015/340, is developed in line with the specifications for personnel licences as required by ICAO Annex 1, and its purpose is to facilitate the recognition of licences at EU level. The means used to display the required information is left to the competent authorities. It should be either first quality paper and/or other suitable material, including plastic cards, which prevent or readily show any alterations or erasures. Any entries to or deletions from the form should be clearly authorised by the competent authority. The size of each page shall be one-eighth A4. There are no EASA requirements for the font type and size. Both the permanent and variable items shall be displayed on or as part of the licence. Only the variable items may appear on a separate or detachable part of the main form. The signature of the holder (as ‘permanent’ item) should appear on the ‘main part’ of the licence.

                What does ‘national licence endorsement’ mean in GM1 ATCO.AR.D.001(c)?            



 Following Standardisation feedback, the Guidance Material in question has been introduced with the aim of allowing competent authorities to enter any additional licensing information deemed necessary, such as national licence endorsements and/or Radio-Telephony (R/T) licences. National licence endorsements may be issued for various reasons. They may convey additional information, according to national needs, but they are not subject to recognition at EU level. Such national licence endorsements may not limit or extend the privileges granted by the licence itself. It is important to note that they are not to be mistaken with national rating endorsements, which cannot be maintained according to Regulation (EU) 2015/340.

                In case we have specimen of the new licences before issuing them, would EASA be in the position to verify whether they comply with the new requirements?            



 EASA would naturally advise competent authorities via various forms and fora on the implementation of the new requirements. However, the advance verification of licences not yet issued would not be in line with the shared competences in this domain and wouldn’t be compatible with the Agency’s task to conduct the standardisation inspections neither.

                What are the assessor prerequisites for assessing applicant OJTIs and applicant assessors?            



 In order to assess for the purpose of the practical instructional techniques course for OJTIs/STDIs, the person shall hold an assessor endorsement and shall have 3 years’ OJTI/STDI experience. This means that only persons who have held at least an ATCO licence can perform such assessments. Currency is not a requirement. This is to ensure that the person in question is capable of maintaining safety during the assessment and capable of fully assessing the skills that are needed for the future OJTI in relation to maintaining safety. The human factor expert in the example may be the most appropriate person to deliver the course, but is not trained for assessing their applicants in the operational context and to verify the safety element to be possessed by the future OJTI.

                Radio-telephony — I cannot find any provisions in Regulation (EU) 2015/340 requiring ATCOs to hold a radio-telephony certificate in order to be able to provide Air Traffic Services (ATS). There is also nothing on this in the licence form.            



 There are no requirements in Regulation (EU) 2015/340 for a radio-telephony licence. These requirements stem from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and are dealt with at national level. However, in accordance with GM1 ATCO.AR.D.001(c), there is the possibility for the competent authority to include the radio-telephony licence in point XIII of the licence format, if they so wish.

                It is still unclear whether training for a rating endorsement is initial training or unit training. Is it up to the competent authority to decide? If training for a rating endorsement is considered to be initial training, does the ATS unit providing the training need to be certified for initial training?             



 Training for rating endorsements can be both initial training and unit training (see ATCO.D.005(a)(1) and (2)). It is up to the training organisation to define the training and include it either in the initial training plan or as part of a unit endorsement course, both of which have to be approved by the competent authority. If the training for a rating endorsement is provided by an ATS unit as part of a unit endorsement course, the ATS unit (Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP)) has to be certified in order to provide training relevant to the rating endorsement in question. The type of training and the rating endorsement, for which the training is provided, shall be indicated to the competent authority when applying for the training organisation certificate (see ATCO.OR.B.001(c)(5)) and shall also be marked on the training organisation’s certificate according to the template provided in Appendix 2 of Annex II.

 As the provision ATCO.D.010(b), referenced in ATCO.D.015(f), explicitly refers to ‛training for an additional rating’, the initial training plan shall include the description of a process to permit an applicant who has successfully completed initial training (therefore holding a student ATCO licence or an ATCO licence) to join an initial training course only for the rating training course therein, to achieve one or more additional ratings. This provision is relevant in particular in the case of integrated initial training courses, which are established in accordance with ATCO.D.020(a) and (b).

                Is it possible for ANSPs to provide training (e.g. transitional, pre-OJT, OJT, and continuation training) when having ‘training’ marked on its ANSP certificate without being certified as an ATCO training organisation?            



 With the new ATCO Regulation (EU) 2015/340 and the introduction of the ATCO TO certificate template, the possibility according to Article 27(3) of Regulation (EU) No 805/2011 stating that ‘The certificate may be issued for each type of training or in combination with other air navigation services, whereby the type of training and the type of air navigation service shall be certified as a package of services’ is not anymore valid.
Furthermore, it is important to note that according to Article 8(2) of Regulation (EU) 2015/340 the certificates for air traffic controller training organisations shall be replaced with certificates complying with the format laid down in Appendix 2 of Annex II to said Regulation, and for the new applicants according to ATCO.AR.E.001(b), if the applicant training organisation fulfils the applicable requirements, the competent authority shall issue a certificate using the format established in Appendix 2 of Annex II.

                When a total number of minimum hours to exercising the privileges of unit endorsement is established e.g. 150 in accordance with ATCO.B.025(a)(3), would it be sufficient for an OJTI to exercise his/hers privilege for 75 hours and the remaining 75 as OJTI?            



 Yes, it would be acceptable. The intent of the rule is to ensure that the OJTIs exercise the privileges of the licence ‘on their own’ and do not maintain the privileges just by instructing.

Said website clearly disclaimed that EASA maintains this list of AltMoCs notified to it by the competent authorities of the Member States ('CAs') for purely information purposes, at the request of the CAs. The content may be subject to changes at any time without prior notice.  This material is amongst others not professional advice, or any form of assessment, judgement or acceptance by EASA.

                What is the status of documents published during the EASA Rulemaking process such as Notice of Proposed Amendment (NPA) or Comment Response Document (CRD)? Can they be used if there is no EASA rule available?             



 NPAs and CRDs are part of the Agency's rulemaking process to inform and consult stakeholders about possible rule changes or newly developed rules. The proposed rules, (provided in an NPA), are obviously not binding and still subject to change, either during the EASA rulemaking process or the Commission's comitology process. While a NPA and CRD may give a broad indication on how the future rule could look like, the Agency generally does not recommend using them before the final rules are published.

 Reference: Regulation (EU) No 2017/373

	When Regulations are published in the Official Journal of the European Union they invariably include several dates. The date of entry into force is usually expressed as the 20th day following publication of the Regulation in the Official Journal of the European Union. It means that the EU rules have been adopted and published - thus producing legal effects - but are not necessarily mandatory on the date of entry into force. The date when they become mandatory is the date of applicability.
The Regulation (EU) No 2017/373 entered into force on 21 March 2017 and the dates of applicability are specified in Article 10.

                Is a DAT certificate issued per organisation or per office?            



 An organisation (= a legal entity) is certified, while the scope of services, for which that organisation/legal entity is entitled to provide services, are listed in the attachment to the service provider’s certificate and there can be multiple offices/locations per organisation. On the other hand, the principle location of the company will be printed onto the EASA certificate, while any additional locations will be listed into the application form as well as in the company’s exposition.

                When the ISO certificate cover only one of the office and the processes are the same, how it could be used as AMC?            



 An ISO 9001 or EN 9100 certificate, issued by an appropriately accredited organisation, could be used as acceptable means of compliance (AMC) for the relevant management system requirements (i.e. quality management elements). In this context, it should be noted that the subject organisation should accept the disclosure of the documentation related to the certification to EASA as the competent authority. On the other hand, the ISO 9001/EN 9100 certificate covers only the quality management elements of the management system, while the other elements as stipulated in the rule that are not covered by ISO/EN certificate should be subject to oversight by the competent authority, such as e.g. adequacy of the processes and procedures.

                What kind of data providers need to be certified in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/373?            



 
	DAT provider that processes aeronautical data and provides an aeronautical database for use on certified aircraft application/equipment having a safety effect should be certified. Systems permanently installed, especially in the cockpit, would fall in general into the scope of the regulation.
	In another words, databases for which the DAT provider is not required to be certified in accordance with the referenced Regulation include but are not limited to databases provided and/or used by the operator of the aircraft that are monitored under the operator’s responsibility and not loaded into certified aircraft applications (e.g. airport moving map used in electronic flight bags (EFBs), take-off and landing performance used in EFBs). Databases that are approved as part of the type design of the aircraft or engine (e.g. engine power settings (take-off, climb, maximum continuous thrust (MCT), and cruise) and aircraft performance data (e.g. take-off distance, V speeds)) do not fall under the scope of certification.
For further details refer to AMC1 DAT.OR.100 Aeronautical data and information and GM1 DAT.OR.100 Aeronautical data and information.

                How does the application process look like and what would be the price quote and time schedule?            



 The application process is defined by following steps:
Future DAT provider makes an application, using the available DAT provider application forms 
The application should include some company documentation (Organisation Exposition and a copy of the national Companies register / Certificate of Incorporation) 
An eligibility check will be done by EASA before proceeding with the next steps.
Charges will differ between the organisations (depending on the organisation scope of work, number of location etc.) as the fee is calculated based on hours spent on certification. The application form for certification includes the possibility for the organisation to request a quote. If this is option is selected, EASA will send the corresponding quote after assessing the information delivered together with the documentation. No certification activity is started until the organisation accepts the quote.
Once the quote is accepted, a Kick-Off Meeting between EASA and the organisation is organised in order to launch formally the activity. Certification tasks will start at that meeting.
The duration of the assessment depends on the type of services and the compliance status of the organisation. Typically, as a minimum, an on-site audit is organised although it can be extended depending on the organisation structure (e.g. number of operational sites).

                I have a DAT provider certificate (or equivalent) issued by another authority. Is it possible for EASA to recognise it and/or accept it?            



 “Equivalent” to an EASA certified Type 1 or Type 2 DAT provider are defined in any Aviation Safety Agreement between the European Union (EU) and a third country, including any Technical Implementation Procedures (TIP), or any Working Arrangements (WA) between EASA and the competent authority of a third country.  Up to date information regarding the status of such agreements can be found on our website 'International Cooperation Overview'.

                How can I obtain approval against EUROCAE ED-76(A)/RTCA DO-200A(B)?            



 It should be noted that the DAT certification attests that the databases produced by an organisation can be used by aircraft operators and that they have put in place an appropriate system for the control of the processing of data. In this context, it should be clearly pointed out that the DAT provider that we are addressing, processes aeronautical data and provides an aeronautical database for use on certified aircraft application/equipment (e.g. FMS) having a safety effect. Furthermore, it is important to be noted that the data as such is not subject to certification, but the organisation is subject to certification that demonstrates its capability to produce the subject databases.
More concretely, EUROCAE ED-76(A)/RTCA DO-200A(B) is only one of the means to demonstrate compliance to some of the requirements laid down in the binding act, i.e. Regulation (EU) 2017/373. For the rest of the requirements, the DAT provider needs to demonstrate compliance with the applicable requirements resulting in the issuance of a certificate attesting such compliance.

                At what frequency should terrain and obstacle databases be updated?             



 Terrain and obstacles databases are not subject to major/planned changes, therefore, the principles and criteria applied in the maintenance of terrain and obstacle database should be specified in the DQR, including the frequency with which data products are updated. Depending on the intended use, the data/databases may be derived from the States published data (e.g. AIP) or from other sources (e.g. data services (DAT) providers). The data/databases may be updated based on the availability thereof, new sources that allow to improve their quality (e.g. accuracy or resolution), correction of detected errors, etc. 
	Please note that DAT providers are subject to Regulation (EU) 2017/373 (refer DAT.OR.100 and associated AMC/GM). In this context, when the databases (including terrain and obstacles) are used on certified aircraft application/equipment, (that support the flight operation where incorrect data leads to failures having at least minor or higher failure effect, excluding those databases approved as part of the type design of the aircraft) they should be produced and released by certified DAT providers. 
	In conclusion, the EU law does not address the frequency of terrain and obstacle database updates.

                What are the applicable regulations and requirements for obtaining DAT provider approval?            



 Regulation (EU) 2017/373 that requires DAT provider’s certification from 1 January 2019.
	This regulation is accessible here: Regulation (EU) 2017/373
To support the implementation of said Regulation, please note the associated AMC/GM issued with EASA ED Decision 2017/001/R.
The listed regulatory materials are consolidated in Easy Access Rules for Air Traffic Management/Air Navigation Services: Easy Access Rules for ATM/ANS. These consolidated, up-to-date rules are displayed in an easy-to-read format with advanced navigation features through links and bookmarks and are for free download from the EASA website. The document contains the applicable rules for the providers of Air Traffic Management/Air Navigation Services and other Air Traffic Management network functions, incl. DAT providers. It covers Regulation (EU) 2017/373 and all its annexes (together with the related AMC and GM).
Furthermore, in order to assist stakeholders to prepare for the implementation, EASA organised a workshop focusing on the new requirements and aiming to familiarise with the use of Acceptable Means of Compliance and Guidance Material, being established by the Agency. The presentations provided during this Workshop can be found on the page for the event: '1st EASA Workshop for DAT providers'.

                Which changes require prior approval and which changes do not require prior approval?            



 Competent authority may grant a privilege to service provider(s) to implement changes to its management system, functional system and/or safety management system without prior approval. ATM/ANS.AR.C.025 regulates the competent authority to approve a procedure defining the scope of changes that do not require prior approval and description how such changes will be notified and managed). The mirroring requirements for the service providers are laid down in ATM/ANS.OR.A.040, especially in (b) and for further details please consult AMC2 ATM/ANS.OR.A.040(b) ‘PROCEDURE FOR CHANGES NOT REQUIRING PRIOR APPROVAL’ and GM1 ATM/ANS.OR.A.040(b).The procedure has to be defined by the service provider(s) and approved by the competent authority. The competent authority should evaluate depending on the maturity and reliability of the service provider, what kind of changes could be included this procedure.  Changes that should always require prior approval are e.g. changes to the scope of services, significant change to the operational environment, etc. Changes that the competent authority could allow service provider to implement without prior approval are e.g. nominated personnel/post holders, QMS revisions, etc.

                Is it possible for a legal entity to define two independent organizations, each dealing with specific Database with separate management processes?            



 Usually an organisation (= a legal entity) is certified, while the scope of services, for which that organisation/legal entity is entitled to provide services are listed in the attachment to the service provider’s certificate. However, it is up to the organisation in question to organise its application(s) and the demonstration of compliance for the various services. It should be noted that the potential parallel applications would result in parallel certification and subsequently continuous oversight processes.

                In case of tailored data, is it possible to release Test database upon request of the end user and is statement of conformity required for such database?            



 The change compare to the current LoA scheme is that the tailored data processing (from data origination and/or receiving till its release, incl. signing of the statement of conformity by DAT provider(s)) becomes subject to process verification and oversight by the DAT providers’ competent authority, i.e. by EASA. 
	More concretely, if a DAT provider is requested to:
a) Release a tailored Data as part of a Navigation DB, a statement of conformity is required;
b) Release a DB containing tailored Data only, a statement of conformity is required; 
c) Release a tailored Data as part of a test Navigation DB, no statement of conformity is required, only at a discretion of a DAT provider

                Does the certification of DAT providers require renewal of the EASA certification or is it a one-off procedure? Following EASA certification, who will audit/monitor DAT providers?            



 EASA is the competent authority for the DAT providers. Following the certification process, upon receiving an application for the issuance of a certificate to a DAT provider, EASA needs to verify the DAT provider's compliance with the applicable requirements of Regulation (EU) 2017/373. In this context, EASA may require any audits, inspections or assessments it finds necessary before issuing the certificate. The certificate shall be issued for an unlimited duration. The privileges of the activities that the DAT provider is approved to conduct are specified in the service provision conditions attached to the certificate.
In accordance with ATM/ANS.OR.A.025, DAT provider's certificate shall remain valid subject to:
(1) the DAT provider remaining in compliance with the applicable requirements of Regulation (EU) 2017/373, including those concerning facilitating and cooperating for the purposes of the exercise of the powers of the competent authorities and those concerning the handling of findings as specified in points ATM/ANS.OR.A.050 and ATM/ANS.OR.A.055 respectively;
(2) the certificate not having been surrendered, suspended or revoked.
	Having mentioned this, it could be concluded that EASA is the competent authority for the oversight of DAT providers in addition to its duties for the issuing of respective DAT providers’ certificates.

                Are VFR flight planning and navigation software under the scope Regulation (EU) 2017/373?             



 The provision of data services (= production of databases for certified a/c application/equipment by the DAT providers that would be subject to certification) has been extended from navigation databases (i.e. the current LoA holders’ activities) to aeronautical databases’ activities. To better illustrate the meaning of the DAT provider’s scope of activities (DAT.OR.100), GM1 DAT.OR.100   Aeronautical data and information provides examples of databases provided by certified DAT providers. 
In reference to the VFR Databases, GM1 DAT.OR.100(b)(3) is regarding applications/equipment installed on aircraft certified exclusively for VFR operations. In this context, only those databases used for primary navigation to meet the airspace usage requirements (for example, operations in the airspace where Precision Area Navigation (P-RNAV) is required) would be in the scope of the new DAT requirements.
More concretely, any VFR flight-planning software should be out of the scope of the products provided by certified DAT providers. In addition, as illustrated in GM1 DAT.OR.100, paragraph (b), the organisations putting these products in the market would not be required to be certified in accordance with Regulation (EU) 2017/373. However, it should be clarified that if the mentioned databases were to be fed/used on certified a/c application/equipment (exempted VFR cases addressed above), then the DAT providers would be subject to certification. To illustrate with an example, the airport moving map could be used a non-certified EFB application under operator responsibility, or could be fed into a certified aircraft application (covered by TC/STCs). Consequently, the latter case will fall into the regulation’s scope.

                When flying VFR, what kind of databases fall under scope of Regulation (EU) 2017/373 and which ones are excluded?            



 For specific flight into designated airspace or the use of specific procedures like SID, STAR, LPV approach, RNAV 1, there are minimum equipment requirements where a database is used to describe the flight path. Those need to be provided by a certified DAT provider.
However, there could be another scenario where the GPS is not used as primary navigation, e.g. in a pure VFR environment. Consequently, the database fed into the GPS could be provided by ‘non-certified’ DAT provider. In this latter case, the GPS database is excluded. The intention was to allow the use of tools in support of the VFR only certified aircraft while demanding oversight for databases used for mandatory navigation functions.

                ADR.1 Which aerodromes fall under the EASA Basic Regulation and its implementing rules?            



 According to Art. 4.3(a) of amending Regulation (EC) No 1108/2009 the applicability of the EASA Basic Regulation regarding aerodromes is as follows:
Aerodromes, including equipment, which are located in the territory subject to the provisions of the treaty, open to public use and which serve commercial air transport and where operations using instrument approach or departure procedures are provided, and:
have a paved runway of 800 metres or above; or
exclusively serve helicopters;
	shall comply with this Regulation. Personnel and organizations involved in the operation of these aerodromes shall comply with this Regulation.
Furthermore, Member States can exempt certain aerodromes from having to comply with the European Rules when they have very little passenger traffic and cargo movements. For details on this possibility please refer to Art. 4 (3b) of the Basic Regulation (introduced by amending Regulation (EC) No 1108/2009) and Art. 5 “Exemptions” of the new Regulation (EC) No 139/2014.
In accordance with Art. 4 of Regulation 139/2014 Member States had to report the aerodromes in the scope of EASA and which of these shall benefit from an exemption. The current list is found here.

                ADR.2 Is an extension of the applicability of the EASA rules towards smaller aerodromes planned?            



 At this stage this is not planned. Recital (6) of Regulation (EC) No 1108/2009 amending Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 contemplates this as a future possibility:
(6) It  would not be appropriate to subject all aerodromes to common rules. In particular, aerodromes which are not open to public use and aerodromes mainly used for recreational flying or serving commercial air transport other than in accordance with instrument flight procedures and with paved runways of less than 800 meters, should remain under the regulatory control of the Member States, without any obligation under this Regulation on other Member States to recognize such national arrangements. However, proportionate measures should be taken by Member States to increase generally the level of safety of recreational aviation and of all commercial air transport. The Commission will re-examine in due time, extending the scope of application to aerodromes currently excluded in a modular manner, and taking full account of the impact this might have on such aerodromes.
The review of the EASA Basic Regulation, which was based on EASA opinion 01/2015 does not suggest any change of the applicability of the Basic Regulation to smaller aerodromes. Only a precision of the scope criteria is foreseen at this stage.

                ADR.3 What is the “Certification Basis” of an aerodrome?            



 The term “Certification Basis” (CB) is a key term in the area of oversight of aerodromes. According to Art. 8a, para. 2a and 2b of Regulation (EC) No 216/2018, as amended by 1108/2009, a certificate shall be required in respect of each aerodrome to which the European rules apply. The process of obtaining an aerodrome certificate involves the establishment of the aerodrome’s CB. The concept of the CB embodies the flexibility with which Europe takes account of the non-uniform infrastructure of its airport industry. The CB therefore allows for dealing with local issues by allowing local solutions to deviations from the CS. This CB is proposed by the applicant (usually the aerodrome operator) and is finally decided on by the Competent Authority, the State entity designated to certify and oversee aerodromes as per Art. 3.1 of Regulation (EC) No 139/2014. 
The CB consists of the following:
the applicable Certification Specifications (CSs) related to the type of aerodrome and the operations taking place there;
any provisions for which an Equivalent Level of Safety (ELOS) to that underlying the relevant Certification Specification has been proposed by the aerodrome and accepted by the competent authority;
any Special Conditions (SCs) determined and notified by the competent authority.
The CB can be a list of all the applicable Certification Specifications which are relevant to the aerodrome in question with an indication for each element how each CS is being met or if an ELOS is being argued for or if a special condition is being proposed. The CB would normally reference the documentation showing the compliance, the ELOS or the Special Conditions, as the case may be.
When the applicant has demonstrated that the aerodrome complies with the agreed certification basis as per ADR.OR.B.025 (in annex II of Regulation (EC) No 139/ 2014) one condition for the issuance of the certificate would be met. The certificate shall be considered to include the aerodrome’s CB, and any Deviation Acceptance and Action Documents (DAAD) based on Art.7 “Deviations from certification specifications” of Regulation (EU) No 139/2014, which may have been issued. (See also ADR.AR.C.035 (d) in Annex II of 139/2014 and answer to question ADR.5).

                ADR.4 When establishing the certification basis of aerodrome, to what extent will the Competent Authority be allowed to take into account the differing environments and location of aerodromes?             



 There are altogether three important “flexibility tools” in the process of the certification of aerodrome infrastructure and design. The establishment of an individual aerodrome Certification Basis (CB) includes the possible element of special conditions (SC), as described under ADR.AR.C.025 in annex II of Regulation (EC) No 139/2014. It gives the flexibility to the authority to allow deviations from the Agency’s Certification Specifications when the aerodrome is subject to topographical, physical or other limitations.
Additionally, the concept of the equivalent level of safety (ELOS), as described ADR.AR.C.020 (b) in annex II of Regulation (EC) No 139/2014, allows for technological solutions or alternatives to be introduced into the CB instead of complying with the applicable certification specification/s, under condition that the authority allows for an equivalent level of safety to be demonstrated. (see also the Agency’s Guidance Material for ADR.AR.C.020 and see also answer to question ADR4).
Furthermore, the concept and requirements introduced by Art. 7 “Deviations from certification specifications” of Regulation (EC) No 139/2014 allow competent authorities to accept “legacy” deviations from the certification specifications until the end of 2024. Such “legacy” deviations have to pre-date the coming into force of the said Regulation (i.e. have existed before 6 March 2014) to continue as long as they cannot be captured with the aforementioned concepts, are safety assessed, mitigated and undergo regular reviews to establish their continued legitimacy. Such acceptances may be formalised in what is called a Deviations Acceptance and Action Document (DAAD). (see also answer to question ADR5).

                ADR.5 What is the Deviation Acceptance and Action Document (DAAD) described in Art. 7 of Regulation 139/2014?            



 As a background it is useful to know that the EASA Basic Regulation (BR) had asked the Agency to provide solutions to deviations at existing aerodromes which Member States had already authorized before the entry into force of the BR and which stem from notified deviations from Annex 14 filed by the Member States to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The tool developed by the Agency to deal with such “legacy deviations” is found in Art. 7 “Deviations from certification specifications” of Regulation (EC) No 139/2014. It says the following:
Article 7   Deviations from certification specifications
The Competent Authority may, until 31 December 2024, accept applications for a certificate including deviations from the certification specifications issued by the Agency, if the following conditions are met:​
a. the deviations do not qualify as an equivalent level of safety case under ADR.AR.C.020, nor qualify as a case of special condition under ADR.AR.C.025 of Annex II to this Regulation;
b. the deviations existed prior to the entry into force of this Regulation;
c. the essential requirements of Annex Va to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 are respected by the deviations, supplemented by mitigating measures and corrective actions as appropriate;
d. a supporting safety assessment for each deviation has been completed.
The Competent Authority shall compile the evidence supporting the fulfilment of the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 in a Deviation Acceptance and Action Document (DAAD). The DAAD shall be attached to the certificate. The Competent Authority shall specify the period of validity of the DAAD.
		 
The aerodrome operator and the Competent Authority shall verify that the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 continue to be fulfilled.
This means, that during the initial certification process all existing deviations at an aerodrome must undergo review. Then in a next step all deviations, which cannot be handled with the other flexibility tools provided (i.e. the Equivalent Level of Safety and Special Condition), and which pre-date 2014, can be accepted by the Competent Authority in a “Deviation Acceptance and Action Document” (DAAD), which would be attached to the certificate, but which does not form part of it.
Such a DAAD will have to describe the deviation, contain the outcomes of a safety assessment concerning the deviation and describe how the essential requirements of Annex Va to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 are nevertheless respected by the deviation, when supplemented by mitigating measures and corrective actions as appropriate. It could also be that the Competent Authority includes an action plan for the removal of the deviation at some point in the future. Despite the issuance of a DAAD the deviation/s should be regularly reviewed. 
When a DAAD is issued, there is no pre-defined expiry date. While a “validity period” must be stated, it must not necessarily be a temporal period. It can also be a traffic volume threshold or in relation to a change in the traffic mix (aircraft type) or a condition whereby the rectification (the “fixing”) of a deviation is related to the next time when a piece of infrastructure is changed, renewed, re-furbished or maintained. It is up to the authority to decide. However, after 2024 this possibility to issue a DAAD for newly certified aerodromes will no longer possible for the CAAs as this is a transitional measure only.

                ADR.6 What is the Deviation Acceptance and Action Document (DAAD) described in Art. 7 of Regulation 139/2014?            



 As a background it is useful to know that the Basic Regulation (BR) asked the Agency to provide solutions to deviations at existing aerodromes which Member States had already authorized before the entry into force of the BR and which stem from notified deviations from Annex 14 filed by the Member States to International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO). The tool developed by the Agency to deal with such “legacy deviations” is found in Art. 7 “Deviations from certification specifications” of Regulation (EC) No 139/2014. It says the following:
Article 7 Deviations from certification specifications
The Competent Authority may, until 31 December 2024, accept applications for a certificate including deviations from the certification specifications issued by the Agency, if the following conditions are met:the deviations do not qualify as an equivalent level of safety case under ADR.AR.C.020, nor qualify as a case of special condition under ADR.AR.C.025 of Annex II to this Regulation;
the deviations existed prior to the entry into force of this Regulation;
the essential requirements of Annex Va to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 are respected by the deviations, supplemented by mitigating measures and corrective actions as appropriate;
a supporting safety assessment for each deviation has been completed.

The Competent Authority shall compile the evidence supporting the fulfilment of the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 in a Deviation Acceptance and Action Document (DAAD). The DAAD shall be attached to the certificate. The Competent Authority shall specify the period of validity of the DAAD.
The aerodrome operator and the Competent Authority shall verify that the conditions referred to in paragraph 1 continue to be fulfilled.

This means in effect, that during either the conversion or the certification process all existing deviations at an aerodrome shall be reviewed or in case of conversion be compared with the new Certification Specifications (CS). Then in a next step all of those deviations that cannot be handled with the other flexibility tools provided (i.e. the Equivalent Level of Safety and Special Condition), and which predate 2014 can be accepted by the Competent Authority in a “Deviation Acceptance and Action Document” (DAAD), which would  be attached to the certificate, but which does not form part of it.
Such a DAAD will have to describe the deviation, contain the outcomes of a safety assessment concerning the deviation and describe how the essential requirements of Annex Va to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 are nevertheless respected by the deviation, when supplemented by mitigating measures and corrective actions as appropriate.
It could also be that the Competent Authority includes an action plan for the removal of the deviation at some point in the future and the deviations should be regularly reviewed. After 2024 this possibility of a issuing a DAAD for newly certified aerodromes will no longer possible. However, when a DAAD is issued, there is no pre-defined expiry date. It is worth mentioning though that “validity period” must not necessarily be a temporal period. It can also be a traffic threshold or in relation to a change in the traffic mix or a condition where “fixing” a deviation is related to the next time when a piece of infrastructure is changed, renewed, re-furbished or maintained. It is up to the authority to decide.

                ADR.7 Is it planned to have two different certificates, one for the aerodrome operator and one for the aerodrome infrastructure?             



 Based on the Basic Regulation and as detailed in ADR.AR.C.035 “Issuance of Certificates” under para (b) in annex II to Regulation (EC) No 139/2014 both options are possible.

                ADR.8 Does the EASA certificate replace the ICAO based certificate?            



 The future EASA-based certificate for European aerodromes shall only address the aerodrome safety part of the former (ideally ICAO based) national certificate; as such it does not affect the non-safety related elements which may form part of such certificate/ permit/ license. 
The EASA rules mirror the ICAO Annex 14 rule content 1:1, apart from a few exceptions about which EASA Member States are informed through a comparison exercise called EFOD (Electronic Filing of Differences). 
Moreover, it is at the discretion of the Member States to decide how to insert the new certificate into their own legal structure:  it may replace the former (safety) certificate or come in addition to it. By no means, however, should the insertion of the new certificate impair established privileges and legal finality of non-safety aspects. Recital 9 of Regulation (EC) No 139/2014 should be kept in mind:
(9) Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 only concerns aerodrome certificates to be issued by Competent Authorities in so far as safety aspects are concerned. Therefore, non-safety related aspects of existing national aerodrome certificates remain unaffected.

                ADR.9 Is it the case that only Member State authorities undertake audits and issue certificates or is it planned that EASA will do such audits in the aerodrome domain, like those done by the EU Commission for aviation security?            



 As of 2018 when the transition period has ended, the team of standardisation officers of the EASA aerodrome section will undertake standardisation visits to the Member States and their competent authorities covering the domain of aerodromes. In the context of such a standardisation visit, some (1-2) aerodromes in the visited Member State may be visited to better understand the interactions of the authority and the aerodrome operator with respect to certification and oversight.
However, EASA would not raise findings against the aerodrome operator. The addressee of the standardisation visit remains the Member States and their authorities.

                ADR.10 Safety Management System (SMS) for aerodrome operators: are the EASA rules regarding this area the same as those required by ICAO in Annex 19?            



 In line with ICAO Annex 19, the European rules for aerodromes require that aerodrome operators put into place and maintain a management system, which contains a system to manage safety (SMS). This reflects the need to integrate the various sub-systems used for the management of the different activities of an aerodrome organization (e.g. management of aeronautical data and related activities).
The relevant provisions on the management system of aerodrome operators may be found in the management requirements contained in Subpart D of Annex III of Regulation (EU) No 139/ 2014 (Part ADR.OR), as well as in the related acceptable means of compliance and guidance material. They reflect the Annex 19 requirements and will be updated with updates of Annex 19.

                ADR.11  Is it planned to have a regulation for the design of heliports?            



 Yes, there is a rulemaking task covering heliports, namely RMT.0638 Certification requirements for VFR heliports located at aerodromes falling under the scope of Basic Regulation. It is currently executed as part of the EASA Rulemaking Program under which the following NPA has been published NPA 2017-14 “Certification specifications and guidance material for the design of surface-level VFR heliports located at aerodromes that fall under the scope of Regulation (EC) 216/2008 (CS-HPT-DSN - Issue 1)”.  Until these rules are in place, the respective national regulations are applicable. The future rules for heliports will reflect the recent changes to Annex 14, Vol. II.

                ADR.14 Is there a transition period by which an aerodrome operator has to comply with new or changed certification specifications for aerodrome design?             



 In accordance with ADR.OR.B.050, the aerodrome operator, following an amendment of the certification specifications, must perform a review to identify any certification specifications, which are applicable to the aerodrome; and, if relevant, initiate a change process in accordance with ADR.OR.B.040 and implement the necessary changes at the aerodrome.
The competent authority, for its part, shall process the application for changes in accordance with the steps prescribed in ADR.AR.C.040. During this process, a timeline to reach compliance with the new CS shall be prescribed by the competent authority, depending, amongst other factors, on the nature and the significance of the required change.

                ADR.15 What is the underlying definition of “passenger” in the context of the derogation (exemption) mentioned under Art. 4 (3b) of the EASA Basic Regulation 216/2008 as amended by Regulation (EU) 1108/2009?             



 According to Article 4.3 (b) of the EASA Basic Regulation, a Member State may decide to issue an exemption from the provisions of Regulation (EU) 139/2014 when the aerodrome in question handles no more than 10,000 passengers per year and no more than 850 movements related to cargo operations per year. Further details are also found in Art. 5 of Regulation (EU) 139/2014. 
The term “passenger” is not defined in Regulation (EC) No 216/2008. Looking into other parts of that Regulation and Regulation (EC) No 965/ 2012, there is a differentiation between passengers and crew members. From this it follows, that passengers are all persons on board an aircraft, who are not crew members. This means that for the purpose of calculating whether a given aerodrome can be exempted, all passengers of a given year have to be counted, regardless of whether the operation was commercial or non-commercial. 
This corresponds with the practice at Eurostat in its 2015 “Reference Manual on Air Transport Statistics”, where the following definition is given: “Air Passenger” any person, excluding on-duty members of the flight and cabin crews, who makes a journey by air. Infants in arms are included.”

                ADR.16 The EASA Basic Regulation talks in its Art. 4 (3a) about aerodromes “open to public use”. Can you provide a definition about the meaning of this?             



 The term “public use” is included in Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 as one of the elements for defining which aerodromes shall comply with this Regulation and consequently will need to be certified in accordance with the requirements and administrative procedures laid down in Commission Regulation (EU) No 139/2014. 
In the context of aviation rules, an aerodrome open to public use means that it is generally accessible to use by the public, as opposed to being accessible only to one particular person or a closed group of people. It is up to each Member State to decide on the facilities open to public use, in accordance with their national regulatory framework.
