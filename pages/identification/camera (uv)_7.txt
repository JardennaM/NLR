CoroCAM 8 UAV
Combined IR and Corona imaging camera for use on UAV

The CoroCAM 8 UAV is a combined thermal IR, solar blind corona and video camera, sized and balanced to fit into a standard commercial gimbal and to be lofted by an Enterprise grade UAV.
The UAV also allows for inspection from various directions of hard to reach overhead hardware. Having the camera closer to the hardware under inspection allows the visible camera to capture more detailed images of the physical condition of the components. This is required in order to assign maintenance priority using the EPRI guideline.
The combination of these 3 cameras makes it possible to do both thermal IR and UV inspections at the same time, saving time and effort. Co-location of electrical discharges and hot spots give the inspector more insight into the kind and cause of a fault.
Installation onto the UAV or a tri-pod is quick and easy. The CoroCAM 8 UAV can be remote controlled from a standard radio controller using PWM and SBUS or from a laptop running CoroBASE using an Ethernet data link. Recordings can be done on the CoroCAM 8 UAV or at a combination HDMI display/recorder ground station.
