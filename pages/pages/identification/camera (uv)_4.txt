UV Corona
We have been working with the world leader of UV inspection instruments to develop a low altitude UV Corona discharge detection solution. Used for the detection of an early component failure or faulty manufacturing of conductors and insulators caused by the ionization of the air where the electrical field exceeds a critical value.
This effect is invisible to the human eye as it occurs in a very narrow spectrum band. The corona camera has very precise filters to allow this frequency to be detected and overlayed with a live image.
The solution we have built allows the sensitive camera to be flown on a UAV with all data streams and controls being transmitted in realtime from the ground. This system has been designed specifically for the Power Utilities and Electrified Railway Industries.
