They are either remotely controlled or programmed and fully autonomous. Typically, these are used for entertainment or as a means for filming events or activities. The development of all these LSS UAV goes with an increased risk of seeing them used for military or terrorist actions. Indeed, because of their versatility and current technical capacities, using LSS UAVs to carry small caliber weapons or to deliver an improvised explosive device (IED) to a potential target in an urban environment becomes feasible with relatively low expertise and means. Already, many recent news report the presence of LSS UAV in situations where they could represent serious threats. Due to a technological gap on detection technologies, these potentially harmful LSS UAVS are currently likely to be visually spotted very late by the security teams, typically a few dozen meters from their potential target. Such a conclusion makes the use of capture solutions such as drone-chasing drones, or even using birds of prey, inadequate. Besides, in the context of urban environment, fancy technologies such as jammers, lasers, or other high-energy devices are potentially unsuitable due to possible strict regulations concerning the use of wave emitting devices and a high potential of collateral damage on other equipment. The following study discusses the potential suitability of kinetic energy non-lethal weapons (KENLW) to neutralize LSS UAV in such conditions as the last line of defense. These weapons are designed to minimize permanent or unnecessary injuries when used against human targets. The study is divided into five parts. Firstly, LSS UAV and KENLW are defined and the market is analyzed in order to focus the work on representative candidates of these two categories. Secondly, impacts of KENLW projectiles on LSS UAV are performed in a controlled environment in order to highlight the effect of the impact on the target. The results are presented in terms of V50, which is defined as the velocity characterized by a probability to produce the desired effect of 50%. The projectiles show good potential to break the propellers or even the hull of the LSS UAVs. Thirdly, a theoretic study which objective is to discuss the probability to hit the target is proposed. The results show reasonable probabilities to hit the propellers or the hull with a perfect aiming. Besides, the aiming problem is discussed and highlight the need of dedicated aiming systems to reach the presented results. Fourthly, the potential collateral damage occurring when such projectiles impact human targets is studied. The selected projectiles give mixed results. The most efficient projectiles on the LSS UAV are also the most harmful when impacting the human body. Finally, conclusions concerning the suitability of KENLW systems for neutralizing LSS UAV threats are drawn.Do you want to read the rest of this article?Request full-text Citations (0)References (41)This research hasn't been cited in any other publications.Splenic Laceration and Pulmonary Contusion Injury From Bean Bag WeaponArticleFull-text availableMar 2014West J Emerg MedAmar Patel Shannon Toohey Megan Boysen-Osborn[West J Emerg Med. 2014;15(2):118–119.]ViewShow abstractWhen a drone crashed in front of Gernamy’s Angela Merkel, Press articleC LeonnigT Ruparthe next big threat?

Oukara Nestor Nsiampa Cyril Robbe Alexandre PapyAnti-personnel NLW (Non-Lethal Weapons) are used to impart sufficient effect onto a person in order to deter uncivil, suspect or hazardous behaviour with a low probability of permanent or fatal injury. In many situations of conflict, where the army and law-enforcement units are involved, the use of such weapons can ensure a minimal risk of collateral damage. The most used NLW are Kinetic Energy Non-Lethal Weapons (KENLW) that involve the shooting of a deformable or breakable projectile. Since their first use, real cases indicate that the injuries inflicted by such projectiles may be irreversible and sometimes lead to death, especially for the head impacts. Therefore, there is a necessity to assess the head impacts in order to allow a safer use of such projectiles. This article concludes a 4-year study where three methods, independently developed, are considered to be applicable for the head risk assessment. The first method links force measurements on rigid wall structure with cadaveric and animal impact test results. Lesional thresholds, in terms of the maximum impact force and intracranial pressure, are proposed for unconsciousness, meningeal damages and bone damages, respectively. The second one is based on direct impact force measurements on a specific mechanical surrogate. The third method makes use of numerical simulations using a validated finite element head model. The numerical model allows the prediction of different kind of injuries. Firstly, the necessity of the assessment of the non-lethal head impacts is highlighted through some examples taken from literature. Secondly, the three different methods are detailed and illustrated for different projectiles. Outstanding results are given and a comparison between the different methods is proposed including some correlations between different criteria. Finally, some discussions and remarks conclude the present article.ViewShow abstractAn hybrid experimental/numerical method to assess the lethality of a kinetic energy non-lethal weapon systemArticleJan 2013 Cyril Robbe Nestor Nsiampa Alexandre Papy A. OukaraAssessing the lethality of Kinetic Energy Non-lethal Weapons (KENLW) is very complicated because of the wide variety of projectiles currently in use, as well as the complexity that characterises the interaction between the projectile and the human body. This article describes and applies injury criteria found in the literature to perform a lethality assessment of a 40mm Nobel Sport sponge grenade. The selected criteria are the viscous criterion (VC)max for the thorax, the Energy Density for the skin penetration assessment, and a dispersion criterion to avoid head impact. These criteria are evaluated thanks to a hybrid experimental-numerical approach, and are computed for different velocities of the projectile, corresponding in real life to different distances of engagement. The final results consist of the determined allowable distances of engagement corresponding to a specified risk of lethality. The method is applicable to any KENLW, requiring two experimental tests and numerical simulations.ViewShow abstractQuantification of the uncertainties of high-speed camera measurementsArticleFull-text availableOct 2014 Cyril Robbe Nestor Nsiampa A. Oukara Alexandre PapyThis article proposes a combined theoretical and experimental approach to assess and
quantify the global uncertainty of a high-speed camera velocity measurement. The study is
divided in five sections: firstly, different sources of measurement uncertainties
performed by a high-speed camera are identified and quantified. They consist of
geometrical uncertainties, pixel discretisation uncertainties or optical uncertainties.
Secondly, a global uncertainty factor, taking into account the previously identified
sources of uncertainties, is computed. Thirdly, a sensibility study of the camera set-up
parameters is performed, allowing the experimenter to optimize these parameters in order
to minimize the final uncertainties. Fourthly, the theoretical computed uncertainty is
compared with experimental measurements. Good concordance has been found. Finally, the
velocity measurement uncertainty study is extended to continuous displacement measurements
as a function of time. The purpose of this article is to propose all the mathematical
tools necessary to quantify the individual and global uncertainties, to highlight the
important aspects of the experimental set-up, and to give recommendations on how to
improve a specific set-up in order to minimize the global uncertainty. Taking all these
into account, it has been shown that highly dynamic phenomena such as a ballistic
phenomenon can be measured using a high-speed camera with a global uncertainty of less
than 2%.ViewShow abstractSevere craniocerebral trauma with sequelae caused by Flash-Ball(R) shot, a less-lethal weapon: Report of one case and review of the literatureArticleJun 2015MED SCI LAWJ. HiquetS. Gromb-MonnoyeurThe use of Flash-Ball® as a non-lethal weapon by several special units within the police and police forces started in France in 1995. Little literature is available concerning injuries caused by Flash-Ball® shooting. However, we report the case of a healthy 34-year-old male victim of a Flash-Ball® shooting during a riot following a sports event. This young man presented serious craniocerebral injuries with a left temporal fracture, moderate cerebral oedema, fronto-temporal haemorrhagic contusion along with an extra-dural hematoma and subarachnoid hemorrhage requiring neurological and rehabilitation care for two months leaving important sequelae. Although the risk is obviously lower than with firearms, Flash-Ball® is nonetheless potentially lethal and may cause serious physical injuries, particularly after a shot to the head.

Oukara Nestor Nsiampa Cyril Robbe Alexandre PapyKinetic energy non-lethal projectiles are used to impart sufficient effect onto a person in order to deter uncivil or hazardous behavior with a low probability of permanent injury. Since their first use, real cases indicate that the injuries inflicted by such projectiles may be irreversible and sometimes lead to death, especially for the head impacts. Given the high velocities and the low masses involved in such impacts, the assessment approaches proposed in automotive crash tests and sports may not be appropriate. Therefore, there is a need of a specific approach to assess the lethality of these projectiles. In this framework, some recent research data referred in this article as "force wall approach" suggest the use of three lesional thresholds (unconsciousness, meningeal damages and bone damages) that depend on the intracranial pressure. Three corresponding critical impact forces are determined for a reference projectile. Based on the principle that equal rigid wall maximal impact forces will produce equal damage on the head, these limits can be determined for any other projectile. In order to validate the consistence of this innovative method, it is necessary to compare the results with other existing assessment methods. This paper proposes a comparison between the "force wall approach" and two different head models. The first one is a numerical model (Strasbourg University Finite Element Head Model-SUFEHM) from Strasbourg University; the second one is a mechanical surrogate (Ballistics Load Sensing Headform-BLSH) from Biokinetics.ViewShow abstractDutch firm trains eagles to take down high-tech prey: drones, Press articleS CastleThe evaluation of blunt ballistic impacts of the thoraxArticleFull-text available Cynthia BirThe specific aims of this study included: (1) the determination of human response corridors for blunt ballistic impacts of the thorax and comparison with established biomechanical responses from the automotive safety literature, (2) the determination of an injury criterion to assess the continuum of injuries related to blunt ballistic impacts of the thorax, (3) the refinement and validation of a biomechanical surrogate and subsystem test procedure for the evaluation of blunt ballistic impacts, and the evaluation and comparison of existing methods used by the non-lethal community in terms of biofidelity and injury assessment, (4) the development of theoretical models to estimate the effects of blunt ballistic impacts to the human and existing surrogates. ^ Three impact conditions were selected to biomechanically assess blunt ballistic impacts to the thorax. The conditions included (A) 140 g mass at 20 m/s (B) 140 g mass at 40 m/s and (C) 30 g mass at 60 m/s. Testing was conducted on cadaveric specimens, existing simulants used for penetrating munitions (clay and gelatin), a biomechanical surrogate (3-RCS), and a mathematical model (Lobdell). The cadaveric specimens provided information needed to develop human response corridors for the test conditions. After these responses were determined, the remaining surrogates were tested and compared to the corridors established. ^ The results indicate that ordinance gelatin does not display agreement with the human response corridors. Modification of the current behind body armor standard of clay indicates agreement with the human thorax but the information provided by this assessment is limited. A biomechanical surrogate, the 3-RCS, displays an adequate correlation with the force-time corridors established. A correlation factor between the 3-RCS and the human response was also established based on the injury parameter of the viscous response or VC. Logistic regression analysis was conducted on experimental data, which indicated the VC could predict the injuries seen with blunt ballistic impacts. Refinement of the Lobdell mathematical model was also completed in order to assess blunt ballistic impacts. ^ The results of this research provide an initial biomechanical assessment of blunt ballistic impacts. Further refinement of the biomechanical surrogate and the injury parameter in the future will allow for a complete assessment to be conducted in this area of impact biomechanics. ^ViewShow abstractBlunt liver trauma from bean bag ammunitionArticleFull-text availableOct 2008EUR J TRAUMA EMERG S Misha D Luyer Anton HoofwijkPolice departments in Europe are increasingly using nonlethal weapons and/or ammunitions such as a bean bag to restrain and

An autopsy examination of a man who was shot with improved rubber bullets revealed that the bullet caused pulmonary contusion. The bullet was 30 g in weight and consisted of a sponge foam nose with 40-mm diameter and a plastic body. He was not incapacitated and died of suicidal gunshot wound. The case raised a question as to how severe an injury is necessary to deter a person without causing death. A variety of rubber bullets have been used in the world, and they have occasionally produced severe or lethal injuries. A review of the literature demonstrated that the feature of injuries appeared to be related to the type of missile. It becomes more important for a forensic pathologist to be familiar with rubber bullets and injuries caused by them as the use of less-lethal weapon increases.ViewShow abstractPenetrating injury to the chest by an attenuated energy projectile: A case report and literature review of thoracic injuries caused by "less- lethal" munitionsArticleFull-text availableJul 2009World J Emerg SurgJoao B Rezende-NetoFabriccio Df SilvaLeonardo Bo PortoSandro B RizoliWe present the case of a patient who sustained a penetrating injury to the chest caused by an attenuated energy rubber bullet and review the literature on thoracic injuries caused by plastic and rubber "less-lethal" munitions. The patient of this report underwent a right thoracotomy to extract the projectile as well as a wedge resection of the injured lung parenchyma. This case demonstrates that even supposedly safe riot control munition fired at close range, at the torso, can provoke serious injury. Therefore a thorough investigation and close clinical supervision are justified.ViewShow abstractSevere facial rubber bullet injuries: Less lethal but extremely harmful weaponsArticleFull-text availableJul 2009 Roman Hossein KhonsariGilles FleuridasL Arzul Chloé BertolusLess-lethal rubber-bullet weapons are designed to induce blunt injuries that incapacitate violent individuals.
We intend to study the functional and aesthetic impairments and the cost in terms of social health resulting from rubber-bullet facial trauma.
We retrospectively collected all the facial trauma cases caused by mass-appeal, less-lethal guns followed up in two French university hospitals since the year 2000. We did not consider the facial injuries caused by professional, less-lethal, rubber or plastic bullet guns.
We showed that mass-appeal, less-lethal rubber-bullet guns induce severe traumas with irreversible functional consequences and long-term social implications. Victims of facial rubber-bullet traumas should be managed like high-energy trauma patients and benefit from extremely careful primary wound care.ViewShow abstractInjuries caused by rubber bullets: A report on 90 patientsArticleJun 1975BRIT J SURGR MillarW.H.

Their use has been controversial, with a number of fatalities. In the week beginning July 7, 1996, some 8,000 plastic bullets were fired during widespread rioting.
Details of injuries attributed to plastic bullets were obtained retrospectively from patient notes for the period July 8 to 14, 1996, in six hospitals. A total of 172 injuries in 155 patients were recorded.
Nineteen percent of injuries were to the face/head/neck, 20% were to the chest or abdomen, and 61% were to the limbs. Abbreviated Injury Scale scores ranged from I to 3. Forty-two patients were admitted for hospitalization, three to intensive care units. No fatalities occurred.
Plastic bullet impact to the abdomen or above may cause life-threatening injuries. Below this site, major trauma is unlikely.ViewShow abstractThe Injury Pattern of a New Law Enforcement Weapon: The Police Bean BagArticleNov 2001ANN EMERG MEDDirk de BritoKathryn R. ChallonerAshish SehgalWilliam MallonThis case series describes the injury pattern of the police bean bag, a new weapon adopted by US law enforcement agencies.
Retrospective chart review between 1996 and 2000 identified bean bag injuries. Autopsy data were gathered for 1 fatality. Circumstances of the shootings, toxicology results, and psychiatric diagnoses, if any, were recorded.
Thirty-nine men and 1 woman between the ages of 16 and 77 years were shot by officers of either the Los Angeles Police Department or the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department. The fatality was caused by massive hemothorax after thoracic penetration. The locations of serious penetrating injuries included the thoracic cavity, eye, abdomen, arm, and leg. Blunt injuries included splenic rupture, pneumothorax, compartment syndrome, testicular fracture, subcapsular liver hematoma, and cardiac contusion. Complications included hemothorax, pneumopericardium, wound infection, compartment syndrome, and osteomyelitis. Psychiatric consultation was requested for 27 (69.2%) of 39 surviving patients. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) Axis I was used for diagnosis in all 27 patients. Psychosis was diagnosed in 16 (59.3%), suicidal ideation in 15 (55.6%), and major depression in 6 (22.2%) of the 27 cases. Schizophrenia had previously been diagnosed in 7 (25.9%) of the 27 cases. All but 1 of the patients had toxicology screenings performed, and the results of 29 (74.4%) of 39 were positive. Of these 29 positive results, 15 (51.7%) were positive for alcohol and 8 (27.6%) were positive for cocaine.
Awareness of the broad scope of potential injuries mandates a thorough evaluation of both blunt and penetrating trauma in patients shot with police bean bags. The scope of these injuries raises significant public health considerations because use of this weapon has been adopted by law enforcement agencies in all 50 states and at least 10 countries.ViewShow abstractBlunt and penetrating injuries caused by rubber bullets during the Israeli-Arab conflict in October, 2000: A retrospective studyArticleJun 2002LANCET Ahmad MahajnaNabil Aboud Ibrahim Harbaji Michael M KrauszLow-velocity rubber bullets were used by Israeli police to control riots by Israeli-Arabs in early October, 2000. We aimed to establish the factors that contribute to severity of blunt and penetrating injuries caused by these missiles.
We analysed medical records of 595 casualties admitted. We assessed relation of severity of injury to type of bullet, anatomical region of injury, and final outcome. Severity of injury was established by the abbreviated injury scale, and we calculated injury severity score.
151 males and one female (age range 11-59 years) were included in the study, in whom 201 proven injuries by rubber bullets were detected. Injuries were distributed randomly over the body surface and were mostly located in the limbs (n=73), but those to the head, neck, and face (61), chest (39), back (16), and abdomen (12) were also frequently noted. 93 (61%) patients had blunt injuries and 59 (39%) penetrating ones. Severity of injury was dependent on ballistic features of the bullet, firing range, and anatomic site of impact. Two casualties died after a penetrating ocular injury into the brain and one died as a result of postoperative aspiration after a knee injury.
Resistance of the body surface at the site of impact (elastic limit) is the important factor that ascertains whether a blunt or penetrating injury is inflicted and its severity. Inaccuracy of rubber bullets and improper aiming and range of use resulted in severe injury and death in a substantial number of people. This ammunition should therefore not be considered a safe method of crowd control.ViewShow abstractInjury patterns related to use of less-lethal weapons during a period of civil unrestArticleSep 2003J EMERG MED Joe Suyama Peter D Panagos Matthew SztajnkrycerDawn BarnesThis case series documents injury patterns related to beanbag and other less-lethal (LL) weapons during a period of civil unrest in a major U.S. city. A retrospective review of injuries related to LL weapons usage presenting to an urban Emergency Department (ED) from April 10, 2001 to April 18, 2001 was performed. Patients under 18 years of age and those without signed consent to treat were excluded. Twenty-seven patients were identified. Two were excluded due to lack of signed consent for treatment. Mean age was 28.4 +/- 11.7 years; 76% of patients were male. Significant morbidity was found in 7 (28%) cases with no fatalities. Three (12%) individuals, with the diagnoses of pulmonary contusion, liver laceration, and Achilles tendon rupture, required admission. Two (8%) individuals had delayed complications of pneumonia and post-concussive syndrome. Reports of injury patterns associated with beanbag munitions in the medical literature are limited. Physicians should be aware of the injuries and delayed sequelae associated with their use.ViewShow abstractPlastic baton round injuriesArticleMar 2005Emerg Med JL G RockeD HughesKevin MaguireF DunnTo review the injuries resulting from a new plastic baton round.
Review of case notes of patients presenting with injuries caused by plastic baton rounds over a four month period in Northern Ireland.
Twenty nine patients were identified, 28 with 30 injuries were included in the study. Eighty nine per cent were male; the average age was 24.3 years. Seven patients required admission. There were no fatalities. Five injuries were to the upper limbs and 16 to the lower limbs. Three patients sustained pulmonary contusions. There were no head injuries.
Although the numbers in this study are small it should be noted that no patient suffered a face, neck, or head injury. This is in contrast with previous studies in which up to 41.4% of attendances were for face, neck, or head injuries. In this study there were seven injuries to the trunk. Of the 14 deaths attributable to plastic baton rounds in Northern Ireland, all have been the result of head or chest trauma. The use of plastic baton rounds has decreased and, while a reduction in head injuries is noted, potentially serious chest injuries are still occurring. It is vital that guidelines on firing are adhered to. A large proportion of people who have been struck by plastic baton rounds do not attend an accident and emergency department and therefore doctors must be aware of patients with potentially serious injuries presenting late.ViewShow abstractSkin Penetration Assessment of Less Lethal Kinetic Energy MunitionsArticleDec 2005J FORENSIC SCI Cynthia Bir Shelby J Stewart Marianne LangnerThe development of less-lethal technologies has provided law enforcement personnel with an alternative to lethal force. Although the less lethal projectile was produced to engender non-penetrating wounds, case studies show that there have been a number of reported penetrating injuries ranging from minor to significant in morbidity. The objective of this study was to determine the energy per unit area required to penetrate various regions of the body. Eight unembalmed postmortem human specimens were procured for this testing. Each specimen sustained a maximum of 25 impacts consisting of shots to the anterior and posterior thorax, abdomen, and legs. A 12-gauge, fin-stabilized, rubber rocket round was used as the impactor for all of the conducted tests. The energy density required for 50% risk of penetration varied from 23.99 J/cm2 for the location on the anterior rib (p = 0.000) to 52.74 J/cm2 for the location on the posterior rib (p = 0.001).ViewShow abstractInjury pattern of the Flash-Ball®, a less-lethal weapon used for law enforcement: Report of two cases and review of the literatureArticleNov 2006J EMERG MED Peter WahlNicolas Schreyer Bertrand YersinLess-lethal weapons are used in law enforcement to neutralize combative individuals and to disperse riot crowds. Local police recently used such an impact weapon, the Flash-Ball, in two different situations. This gun fires large rubber bullets with kinetic energies around 200 J. Although it is designed to avoid skin penetration, impacts at such energies may still create major trauma with associated severe injuries to internal organs. This is a report of 2 patients shot with the Flash-Ball who required medical attention. One could be discharged quickly, but the other required hospitalization for heart and lung contusion. Both patients required advanced investigations including computed tomography (CT) scan. The medical literature on injuries induced by less-lethal impact weapons is reviewed. Impacts from the Flash-Ball can cause significant injury to internal organs, even without penetration. Investigations as for other high-energy blunt traumas are called for in these cases.ViewShow abstractInjuries caused by the attenuated energy projectile: The latest less lethal optionArticleMar 2007Emerg Med JKevin MaguireDeclan M HughesM Sinead FitzpatrickCatherine J BairdTo review the injuries resulting from the attenuated energy projectile (AEP) in patients who present to emergency departments.
Review of case notes of patients presenting with injuries caused by the AEP after three episodes of serious civil disturbance in Northern Ireland from July to September 2005.
14 patients with 18 injuries were identified and included in the study. All patients were male, with an average age of 26.3 years. There were six injuries above the level of the clavicle, to the head, face or neck. There were three chest injuries, seven lower limb injuries and two upper limb injuries. There were no abdominal injuries. Seven patients required hospital admission. Five patients required surgical intervention. One patient required protective, elective intubation and one patient required the insertion of a chest drain.
Although the study numbers were small, 33.33% of injuries were to the head and neck and 16.67% of the injuries were to the chest. The AEP was introduced as a replacement for its predecessor, the L21A1 plastic baton round, because of a theoretical risk of serious or even life threatening head injury from this projectile in certain circumstances. However, in this first survey of its usage, 50% of the injuries presenting to hospital were to the face, neck, head or chest. This injury pattern was more in keeping with older plastic baton rounds than with the L21A1.ViewShow abstractBallistic study of the SAPL GC27 gun: Is it really nonlethal"?ArticleMay 2004WORLD J SURG Eric Voiglio Benoit Frattini Jean-Jacques Dörrzapf Jean-Louis CaillotTo evaluate the potential dangers of the "nonlethal" 12-gauge single-shot handgun SAPL GC27 with Fun-Tir (FT) and mini-Gomm-Cogne (mGC) ammunition, a ballistic study was performed with both types of ammunition. Nine unembalmed human corpses covered with a cloth sheet were shot through the right and left pectoral regions. With the mGC ammunition, rib fractures were observed when the firing range was less than 2 meters, skin perforation when the range was less than 1.5 meters, with lung injuries at less than 0.2 meter; the heart and the aorta were lacerated at contact range (0 meter). No skin perforation was observed with the FT ammunition, but rib fractures were observed when it was fired at up to 2 meters. Our study shows that the mGC ammunition, shot by the CG27 firearm, can be lethal at contact range and that pellets penetrate the skin at ranges of less than 1 meter. These results led us to conclude that this weapon is too dangerous to be marketed as a "nonlethal" weapon. The term "reduced wounding power weapon" is preferable.ViewShow abstractJoin ResearchGate to find the people and research you need to help your work.15+ million members118+ million publications700k+ research projectsJoin for freeRecommendationsDiscover more publications, questions and projects in Unmanned Aerial VehiclesProjectRisk assessment of kinetic energy non-lethal weapons (KE NLW) Alexandre Papy Cyril Robbe Nestor NsiampaView projectProjectRisk assessment of kinetic-energy non-lethal weapons Alexandre Papy Cyril Robbe A.

[Show full abstract] systems have limited computing power and energy resources, which means that sometimes it is difficult for drones to finish their tasks on schedule. A solution to this is required so that drone clusters can complete their work faster. One possible solution is an offloading scheme between drone clusters. In this study, we propose an opportunistic computational offloading system, which allows for a drone cluster with a high intensity task to borrow computing resources opportunistically from other nearby drone clusters. We design an artificial neural network-based response time prediction module for deciding whether it is faster to finish tasks by offloading them to other drone clusters. The offloading scheme is conducted only if the predicted offloading response time is smaller than the local computing time. Through simulation results, we show that our proposed scheme can decrease the response time of drone clusters through an opportunistic offloading process.View full-textArticleTotal system error analysis of UAV-CRP technology for monitoring transportation infrastructure asset...November 2018 · Engineering Geology Surya Sarat Chandra Congress Anand PuppalaCody L.

[Show full abstract] drones for such monitoring purposes have been propelled by advancements in aerial vehicle platforms and image-analyses software. Evaluating UAVs for high-quality infrastructure-distress data monitoring has been a major focus for this research. Photogrammetry is the science of measuring distances from two or multiple images of an object and close range photogrammetry (CRP) can be accomplished by using an optical camera mounted on a UAV platform and taking the images of the infrastructure object. This technology, hereafter termed as UAV-CRP technology, utilizes UAVs coupled with high quality camera lens and a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) device to collect high quality data with fewer ground control points (GCPs). The various pieces of equipment need to have their aerial technology compatibility tested in different environmental conditions and evaluate the imagery that is used for image analyses and interpretations. A comprehensive set of calibration checks were executed using the total system comprising of UAV and accessories to evaluate the imagery quality level of transportation and geotechnical infrastructure data. All the checks performed ensured that the data obtained from the UAV-CRP technology meets the quality requirements for infrastructure data. A case study of pavement infrastructure data was provided to validate the high accuracy UAV-CRP data obtained following the guidelines developed in this paper.Read moreConference PaperFull-text availableDroNet: Efficient convolutional neural network detector for real-time UAV applicationsMarch 2018 Christos Kyrkou George Plastiras Theo Theocharides[...] Christos BouganisUnmanned Aerial Vehicles (drones) are emerging as a promising technology for both environmental and infrastructure monitoring, with broad use in a plethora of applications.

This paper therefore, explores the trade-offs involved in the development of a single-shot object detector based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that can enable UAVs to perform vehicle detection under a resource constrained environment such as in a UAV. The paper presents a holistic approach for designing such systems; the data collection and training stages, the CNN architecture, and the optimizations necessary to efficiently map such a CNN on a lightweight embedded processing platform suitable for deployment on UAVs. Through the analysis we propose a CNN architecture that is capable of detecting vehicles from aerial UAV images and can operate between 5-18 frames-per-second for a variety of platforms with an overall accuracy of ~95%. Overall, the proposed architecture is suitable for UAV applications, utilizing low-power embedded processors that can be deployed on commercial UAVs.View full-textArticleFull-text availableSurgical and Medical Applications of Drones: A Comprehensive ReviewJuly 2018 · JSLS: Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons / Society of Laparoendoscopic SurgeonsJames C.
