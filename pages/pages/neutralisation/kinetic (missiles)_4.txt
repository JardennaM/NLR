Counter-UAS Technologies 

Battelle’s counter unmanned aerial systems (cUAS) expertise is built on a long history of innovation in communications, electronic warfare and countermeasures, and a strong understanding of evolving customer needs. In response to the real dangers posed by commercial UAS to government agencies, officials and assets, Battelle has created a cUAS focus area including the Battelle DroneDefender® Counter-UAS Device. 
Applications
While used mostly by the military, small UAS, or drones, are now widely available. With increased availability comes increased risk.

Traditional defense mechanisms against small UAS, such as shooting them down, pose safety risks in many situations. So how can agencies of the federal government defend against drones and protect what matters most? Battelle’s systems and expertise offer a solution.

Products
The DroneDefender device is a non-kinetic cUAS solution developed to instantaneously defend airspace against commercial drones without compromising safety or risking collateral damage. The device quickly disrupts an adversary's control of a drone, neutralizing it so that no remote action, including detonation, can occur, minimizing drone damage and risk to public safety.

Handheld Unit – The DroneDefender handheld units are portable, intuitive and man-in-the-loop. The system employs two different defenses to disrupt unwanted UAS—remote control disruption and GPS disruption. Learn more about the handheld version.  

Ground-based Unit – The DroneDefender ground-based system leverages the technology developed for the handheld system for a more capable cUAS solution. The remote control defeat capability can be paired with a detection and tracking system and integrated with almost any 360° positioner. By mounting the disruption capability on a mechanical positioner, the ground-based DroneDefender system utilizes significantly amplified power, increased antenna gains, and the precision aim-point of the positioner to neutralize UAS threats at much greater distances than the handheld version. 


Services
cUAS Research and Development – Extensive work fielding technology in this area has provided Battelle valuable insight into operational needs, challenges and ever-evolving threats.

Battelle uses this knowledge to support continuous, rapid upgrade of its proprietary systems and to offer engineering advisory services to help the U.S. government and their allies stay ahead of adversaries on the battlefield.


Benefits
Protecting what matters most is Battelle’s priority. Unidentified UAS can pose a serious risk to government agencies and officials – both military and civilians – but Battelle has solutions. The DroneDefender systems couple innovative technology with efficient design for safe, reliable drone defense, right at your fingertips.
