OVERVIEW







SKYWALL CAPTURES DRONES AND PROTECTS



PHYSICAL DRONE CAPTURE 



    		  	No electronic countermeasure     		  


    		  	Predictable outcome    		  



PROPORTIONATE RESPONSE 



    		  	Keeps the captured target intact to allow forensic investigation    		  



HANDHELD 



    		  	Highly mobile to allow flexibility during the mission    		  



LOW COLLATERAL DAMAGE RISK 



    		  	Controlled descent using a parachute    		  


    		  	All projectile parts remain attached    		  


    		  	Targeted counter-measure aiming and release    		  



 




SkyWall100 is an operationally-deployed system that gives a mobile operator the ability to physically capture a drone in a net, used in conjunction with electronic counter-measures for a layered defence, or in environments where electronic attack cannot be deployed.




It uses compressed air to launch a projectile up to the drone after the operator has targeted it using the onboard SmartScope, that compensates for drone speed and range automatically. Conventional weapons often fail to incapacitate a drone and do not offer a proportionate response to the drone threat and they can also escalate a situation when used in the vicinity of large crowds.
SkyWall100 can be used as a standalone drone defence solution but can also be integrated with a wider security system, using the skylink module, to offer a highly capable counter drone package. A single SkyWall100 system can protect an area or multiple systems can be deployed from mobile units to protect a large site.







AN INTEGRATED PART OF YOUR MISSION








 



01
COST EFFECTIVE
Developed originally for homeland security and law enforcement operations.
Low initial and through life costs. Projectiles are designed to be reused a large number of times.
With multiple systems, SkyWall100 has been deployed to protect large areas.







 



02
HIGHLY MOBILE
A single operator can provide mobile point security.
Lightweight construction minimises weight.
Compressed air system de-energises for safe storage, handling and transport.







 



03
LOW COLLATERAL DAMAGE
Several built in safety features to ensure it is safe to use in public areas.
Automatic parachute deployment for controlled descent of the captured drone and projectile.







 



04
PHYSICAL CAPTURE
Safe recovery for forensic analysis and evidence.
Defend against all types of aerial drone, now and future.
Zero RF or GPS interference in urban envrionments.







 



05
TARGETING SYSTEM
An advanced targeting system gives a high capture rate on static or moving targets.
The SmartScope measures environmental factors that effect performance and compensates as required.





 

 







PROJECTILES








SkyWall projectiles are re-useable and can carry a range of counter measures. The SP40 includes a parachute which controls the descent of a captured drone.
This minimises the risk of any collateral damage and keeps the drone intact. It allows forensic investigation and enables identification of the operator.
If the drone eludes capture, the projectile deploys regardless and controls the safe descent of the tethered components.

PROTECTING THE BERLIN AIR SHOW








CASE STUDY







SkyWall100 has been deployed to protect the Berlin Air Show from drone threats, ensuring security and safety can be enforced.




German policing authorities deployed SkyWall100 again at the Berlin Air Show, as part of a system called GUARDION, and thus alongside other technology from across Europe; radar systems will detect potential targets and electronic countermeasures will work with SkyWall to track and stop any confirmed threats.
All of the deployed technologies and products are linked together using a command and control system that was originally developed for the military: TARANIS® by ESG Elektroniksystem- und Logistik- GmbH. Based near Munich in Germany, ESG has identified the most capable products that mitigate the drone threat and united them into a layered defence system to achieve a highly capable complete system, called “GUARDION”.
The GUARDION system allows drones to be detected, tracked and neutralised in a safe way. Allowing it to be deployed in built-up areas and public spaces. The SkyWall net capture systems ensure that drones can be quickly and safely neutralised when required.
