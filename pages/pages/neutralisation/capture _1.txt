Neutralization:
Drones can not only invade restricted zones, but also carry drugs, guns, chemical substances or even bombs. The challenge is not only to detect a malicious drone, but to be able to neutralize it as well.
Drone countermeasures can be passive and active. When passive countermeasures are applied, the threat is reduced without actually disrupting the drone. This can be achieved by sending security personnel to intercept the drone or catch the drone operator.
Active countermeasures are used to physically stop the drone. Our company can offer different kinds of equipment for active drone countermeasures that are considered to be the most practicable and effective on the market: jamming systems, interception systems, drone rifles, drone capture nets, anti-drone lasers.







Long Range Acoustic Devices
LRAD, or acoustic cannon, is used to neutralize a drone operator by means of non-lethal, non-kinetic control. LRAD disorientates the UAV operator with a loud directional sound and distracts him from controlling a drone.

Jammers
Jamming systems represent one of the most effective tools for neutralizing drones and UAVs making them to land, crash, return to the operator as well as cancel the transfer of photos and videos from the camera installed on the drone. RCIED jammers are used for blocking explosive devices.
