Drone/ Small UAV Detection

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, commonly known as drones, have seen a dramatic rise in popularity over the course of the last decade, making small UAVs accessible to the general public for both commercial and recreational use. The FAA predicts the number of individual UAVs flying in the US to be as many as 30,000 by 2020. Given the recent number of incidents involving UAVs flying near or landing on critical infrastructures the world over - the White House, the Golden Gate Bridge, nuclear sites in France, prison facilities to transport contraband, the Prime Minister of Japan's office, to name a few - the figure from the FAA is alarming. While traditional security measures like radars or acoustic sensors have been unsuccessful in detecting the small electromagnetic signature and low speed of micro or small UAVs, infrared thermal technology is able to fulfill the task in detecting these threats at a distance to prevent harm to people or damage to critical infrastructures. 







Challenges specific to UAV/drone detection:                                                                                                                             

UAVs' small size and low electromagnetic signature go unregistered by more traditional detection measures, such as radars, acoustic sensors (and also are more susceptible to weather conditions) 
Accessibility, low costs contribute to allowing any persons who wish to obtain a UAV the opportunity to fly one 
Paraplanes, commonly used to smuggle drugs over the US Southern border are hard to spot and can carry hundreds of pounds of payload

SolutionDownload our case study on drone swarms/small UAVsDownload our UAV White PaperSpynel's infrared thermal imaging technology ensures that any object hot or cold will be seen by the thermal imager, day or night, making it impossible for a UAV to be stealthy. Coupled with its own proprietary advanced intrusion detection software, Cyclope, any unlimited number of objects - airborne, terrestrial or maritime - are automatically detected and tracked. This helps assure that no event is missed over a long-range, wide area surrounding and specifically for UAV detection basic classification of targets (ground or airborne) is based on elevation calibration and all air targets are represented by a small plane icon. To read more about all the benefits associated with having Spynel as a solution for anti-drone measures, please click here!
