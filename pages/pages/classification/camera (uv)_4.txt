Description




Daycor Corona Camera
CORONA CAMERAS CORE FUNCTIONis to reveal corona and pinpoint the exact location
Ofil's DayCor® cameras are used by reliability engineers to prevent and manage equipment failure. Ofil's systems include: bi-spectral UV-Visible cameras and UV imagers classified as Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) equipment. UV inspection complements other technologies such as PD measurement, Infrared, ultrasonic etc. A comprehensive maintenance approach requires inspection by an imaging camera and other available technologies.
Ofil is the market leader manufacturer whose systems are renown for having the highest sensitivity to UV discharge. Ofil's systems are being used globally. DayCor® corona cameras are used by electrical utilities for inspection of high & medium OH transmission lines, Distribution, Substations, Motors' workshops, High-Voltage Laboratories, Mines, Refineries, Heavy industry, Data centers and other, as handheld, airborne, vehicle mounted and standalone railroads.
Facilities' maintenance strategies have changed from, rum-to-fail or time-based management to predictive & condition-based or reliability-centered management thereby reducing operation and maintenance costs. Corona cameras collect data that assists predicting failures patterns and prioritizing preventive proactive activities. Facilities dedicate resources to these proactive maintenances and minimize thereby high repair cost and unexpected shutdown. Reliability management involves using reliable instruments that indicate and pinpoint faults and potential faults on time, precisely, and easily.
THE ADVANTAGES OF USING DayCor®CORONA CAMERASUsing DayCor® sensitive coronas camera is clearlyan advantageous practice, because it is» Nondestructive» Allow inspecting while systems are powered» Allow inspecting remote objects» Provide data in real time» Portray corona in its natural occurrences» Enable visualizing both the discharges and thefaults» Provide assessments to the severity ofdischarges» Convenient mode of operation, easy & intuitiveDayCor® CAMERAS BASICS» Visualize UVc» Merge UV & visible imaging» Amplify UV signals» Assess severity of corona PD» Record findingsThe solar radiation is being blocked by the Ozone layerin the UVc range “solar blind” region of 240-280nm. Afraction of the UV radiation emitted by corona is in thisrange. Daytime corona cameras take advantage of thisfact and use special filters to filter in signals generated bycorona in the UVc while filtering out all other. The camerauses 2 spectral channels: one for corona UV signals andone for the visible light from the same scene. The UVchannel undergoes amplification processes to enableseeing the corona. Finally, the camera collects the light fromboth channels and presenting a perfectly merged view of thesource of discharge and the discharge itself.
