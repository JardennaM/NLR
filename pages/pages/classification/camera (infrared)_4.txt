Introducing the Zenmuse XT2 
The Zenmuse XT2 is the first fully DJI integrated EO/IR (optical and thermal) camera and gimbal unit available on the drone market. No more worrying about third party gimbals, additional playback screens, and extra wires. The DJI Zenmuse XT2 relays full 4k video footage and either 336x256 or 640x512 infrared imagery in real time to the remote controller. With FLIR MSX technology, thermal video is overlaid on the 4K video in real time giving the remote pilot in command a full understanding of the situation at hand.

 DJI Zenmuse XT & XT2 Infrared Drone Camera Comparison 
Infrared drone cameras such as the DJI Zenmuse XT, XT2, FLIR Duo Pro R, and the FLIR Vue Pro come in either 336x256 or 640x512 pixel resolution options, different lens configurations and either 9 or 30Hz framerate choices. See how the field of view (FOV) of the camera changes depending on the resoultion and lens option in this video! Visit our  How Thermal Drones Work for more information on framerates, lens options, and resolutions. 





More About Thermal Drones
There are many ways thermal imagery can help enhance our lives. From assisting First Responders in search and rescue missions to roof inspection (to find heating or cooling issues or moisture spots), thermal imaging is changing the way we see the world around us. The recent boom in the drone industry and the addition of thermal imaging to drones has made that change even greater. Now there are almost no limits to what can be explored with thermal cameras.
Police and Fire Departments are some of the largest adopters of thermal drone technology.  Law Enforcement can use drones for many things, but thermal imagery is particularly useful when tracking subjects at night or searching for a suspect in almost any situation.  Fire Departments can use thermal drones to monitor fires through dense smoke, thereby improving hose efficiency and ensuring all people are rescued from the flames.
Search and Rescue is among the industries most heavily affected by the use of drones. Search times can be significantly reduced while limiting potential risk to the party being rescued as well as rescuers with the use of drone technology. Thermal imaging is a major tool for search and rescue. Body heat naturally makes humans stand out from plant life, making them easy to spot very quickly. Most thermal cameras also have the option to change the color palette for a wide variety of options to make sure you can see exactly what you’re looking for, making it an extremely useful tool in any Search and Rescue organization. Visit our  How Drones Are Assisting SAR and Disaster Relief Efforts blog for more information.
