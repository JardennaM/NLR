The generalizability within our wide problem class constitutes an important foundation for our theoretical contribution.  ...... We reflect this role of explanatory theory by explicitly deriving design principles that serve as a link between design requirements and design features. This thorough conceptualization of the problem is a key distinction from previous literature (e.g., Ayoade et al., 2018;Liang et al., 2017;Machado & Fröhlich, 2018), and it facilitates the generalizability of our findings, which enables our theoretical contribution.  ...... Our research has important design implications for SDPSs that address IoT- related security and privacy challenges ( Ayoade et al., 2018;Crossler & Posey, 2017;Liang et al., 2017), specifically with respect to the value proposition of blockchain technology. Blockchain-based SDPSs inherit core characteristics of blockchain technology (Notheisen et al., 2017) and therefore are particularly useful in certain scenarios (see Table 5).  ...Privacy-Preserving Data Certification in the Internet of Things: Leveraging Blockchain Technology to Protect Sensor DataArticleFull-text availableMar 2019J ASSOC INF SYST Mathieu Chanson Andreas Bogner Dominik Bilgeri Elgar Fleisch Felix WortmannA constantly growing pool of smart, connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices poses completely new challenges for business regarding security and privacy. In fact, the widespread adoption of smart products might depend on the ability of organizations to offer systems that ensure adequate sensor data integrity while guaranteeing sufficient user privacy. In light of these challenges, previous research indicates that blockchain technology may be a promising means to mitigate issues of data security arising in the IoT. Building upon the existing body of knowledge, we propose a design theory, including requirements, design principles, and features, for a blockchain-based sensor data protection system (SDPS) that leverages data certification. We then design and develop an instantiation of an SDPS (CertifiCar) in three iterative cycles that prevents the fraudulent manipulation of car mileage data. Furthermore, we provide an ex-post evaluation of our design theory considering CertifiCar and two additional use cases in the realm of pharmaceutical supply chains and energy microgrids. The evaluation results suggest that the proposed design ensures the tamper-resistant gathering, processing, and exchange of IoT sensor data in a privacy-preserving, scalable, and efficient manner.View... [8] describes how the integration of IIoT and blockchain will improve the security and efficiency of various industrial sectors such as supply chain, autonomous vehicle and manufacturing plant equipment. Based on blockchain technology, the authors of [9] present a trusted and resilient communication architecture for IIoT applications, which can achieve data assurance, resilience and accountability. To ensure the security and privacy of trading data and consumption in the smart grid energy trading scenario, blockchain is used together with several other technologies including multi-signatures, and anonymous encrypted messaging streams in [10].  ...Performance Optimization for Blockchain-Enabled Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) Systems: A Deep Reinforcement Learning ApproachArticleFull-text availableFeb 2019IEEE T IND INFORM Mengting LiuRichard Yu Yinglei Teng Victor LeungMei SongRecent advances in industrial Internet of things (IIoT) provide plenty of opportunities for various industries. To address the security and efficiency issues of the massive IIoT data, blockchain is widely considered as a promising solution to enable data storing/processing/sharing in a secure and efficient way. To meet the high throughput requirement, this paper proposes a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based performance optimization framework for blockchain-enabled IIoT systems, the goals of which are three-fold: 1) providing a methodology for evaluating the system from the aspects of scalability, decentralization, latency and security; 2) improving the scalability of the underlying blockchain without affecting the system's decentralization, latency and security; 3) designing a modulable blockchain for IIoT systems, where the block producers, consensus algorithm, block size and block interval can be selected/adjusted using the DRL technique. Simulations results show that our proposed framework can effectively improve the performance of blockchain-enabled IIoT systems and well adapt to the dynamics of IIoT.View... In the [11], the authors provide security to the data collected by the drones for secure communication. Both of these methods are interesting and practical.  ...A New Secure Data Dissemination Model in Internet of DronesConference PaperFeb 2019 Shubhani Aggarwal Mohammad Shojafar Neeraj Kumar Mauro ContiData Dissemination is the distribution of data/statistics to the end users. With the adoption of Internet of Drones (IoD) environment for data dissemination, an efficient scheme is proposed which provides data integrity, identity anonymity, authentication, authorization, accountability (AAA) to the system model. We propose a system model having Ethereum based public blockchain distributed network in order to secure drone communication for the data collection and transmission. The proposed model provides secure communication between the drones and the users in a decentralized way. In this paper, blockchain technology is used for the storage of collected data from the drones and update the information into the distributed ledgers to reduce the burden of drones. It also provides integrity, authentication, and authorization to the collected data by the drones in the system model. Motivated by this consideration, the goal of this paper is threefold. First, we select a forger node from the number of drones. Second, we create blocks and validate their processes. Third, we provide secure data dissemination by applying Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism. Afterward, we evaluate the security of the presented system model compared against the corresponding ones of some state-of-the-art in terms of communication time/cost. The results confirm that our system model is reliable and scalable for data dissemination in the IoD environment.View... Therefore, blockchain is better to handle and tolerate an attack, since if a user is compromised, it will not be affected as blockchain will be maintained by every other user in the network. Holding a copy of data for each IoT data will enhance the information sharing, however, it presents new processing and storage challenges [60].  ...Intersections between IoT and distributed ledgerChapterFull-text availableJan 2019ADV COMPUT Hany F. AtlamGary B. WillsThe Internet of Things (IoT) is growing exponentially. It allows not only humans but also all various devices and objects in the environment to be connected over the Internet to share their data to create new applications and services which result in a more convenient and connected lifestyle. However, the current centralized IoT architecture faces several issues. For instance, all computing operations of all nodes in the network are carried out using a single server. This creates a single point of failure in which if the server goes down, the entire system will be unavailable. Also, the IoT centralized architecture is an easy target of various types of security and privacy attacks, since all IoT data collected from different devices is under the full authority of a single server. Therefore, adopting one of the Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) for the IoT may be the right decision. One of the popular types of DLTs is the blockchain. It provides an immutable ledger with the capability of maintaining the integrity of transactions by decentralizing the ledger among participating nodes in the blockchain network which eliminates the need for a central authority. Integrating the IoT system with the blockchain technology can provide several benefits which can resolve the issues associated with the IoT centralized architecture. Therefore, this chapter provides a discussion of the intersection between IoT and DLTs. It started by providing an overview of the DLT by highlighting its main components, benefits and challenges. The centralized IoT system is also discussed with highlighting its essential limitations. Then, the integration of blockchain with IoT is presented by highlighting the integration benefits. Various application and challenges of integrating blockchain with IoT are also discussed.View... Moreover, blockchain also provides secure access and identity manage- ment possibilities. Regarding the integration of blockchain in the application field of M2 M/Internet of Things (IoT) the literature review provides several publications [9][10][11][12] dealing with secure data storage and data integrity in relation with blockchain. However, none of the publications [9][10][11][12] consider the blockchain technology for using in connection with trust management systems and the computed trust values.  ......

Several trust management systems using different trust evaluation techniques are presented in the application field of M2M. However, most of them do not provide a secure way to store the computed trust values in the community. Moreover, the trust agents participating in the trust evaluation process are not securely identified and could lead to misbehavior among the trust agents resulting in non-reliable trust values. This research identifies several problems regarding decentralized M2M application services and the trust evaluation process. In order to overcome these issues this research proposes a novel approach by integrating blockchain technology in trust evaluation processes. Moreover, this publication presents a concept for using blockchain within the system for decentralized M2M application service provision. Finally, the combination of P2P overlay and blockchain network is introduced in order to verify the integrity of data.View... For a specific example of B-IoT data storage management, when combined with a peer- to-peer distributed file system such as IPFS (Benet 2014), the blockchain can be the backbone for establishing a robust and scalable firmware update service for the managed IoT devices ( Lee and Lee 2017). Also, Liang et al. (2017) propose to enhance the resilience of IoT data using the block- chain. Examples for trade of goods and data include peer-to-peer smart lock services (Prisco 2016;Han et al. 2017), decentralized electronic mar- ketplaces (Subramanian 2017), thing-to-thing micro payment (Lundqvist et al. 2017), and energy trading (Aitzhan and Svetinovic 2016).  ...Blockchain and the Internet of Things: A Software Architecture PerspectiveChapterJan 2019 Chun-Feng LiaoChien-Che Hung Kung ChenWe can perceive the advent of smart living spaces attributed to the fast emerging of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies. By combining with the blockchain technology, many innovative business models can be brought into reality. This chapter examines the state of the art and design issues of IoT and the blockchain integration from software architecture perspective. In particular, four typical architectural styles for such systems are presented and discussed. The presented architectural styles are useful for helping developers make appropriate design decisions.View... This alienates the security risks due to 52% the greater number attack and fork issues. As the longest chain is the eventually authentic, the other attacks become null and void as they end up being unparented forks [51].  ...A Technological Perspective of Blockchain SecurityArticleFull-text availableNov 2018 Dr. Yusuf Perwej Nikhat Akhtar Dr. Firoj ParwejBlockchain has swiftly become one of the most dominant and promising technologies of the past couple of years. The information security is the key to the development of contemporaneous Internet technology. The distributed mechanism, scripted mechanism, password mechanism and decentralized mechanism of the Blockchain present a perfectly new perspective for the development of Internet information security technology. Blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a successively increasingly list of records called blocks that are secured from any kind of interfere with and revision endeavor. A word that often emerges when talking about Blockchain is Bitcoin. The numerous people still confuse Blockchain with Bitcoin although, they are not the same. Bitcoin is just one of several applications that use Blockchain technology. In Blockchain every block contains a time stamp and a link to the previous block. Blockchain extant level of security of a system and data perspective for both private and public ledgers. Alternatively, uploading data to a cloud server or storing it in a single location, as well as breaking everything into small chunks and distributes them across the whole network of computers. In this paper, we try to conduct a comprehensive survey on the Blockchain security as well as the challenges and opportunities for the prospective of security and privacy of data in Blockchain. In its present state, several leading companies and governments detect demonstrations of the Blockchain integrated into identity management, credential validation, finance, supply chain, property exchange recording, and other territory.View... Accountability Combined with cryptography algorithms and timestamping function, it is difficult for attackers to modify a past event. Blockchains assume the presence of adversaries in the network and nullify the adversarial strategies by harnessing the computational capabilities of the honest nodes, making the information exchanged resilient to manipulation and destruction [27]. The rec- onciliation process between entities is sped up due to absence of trusted central authority or intermediary.  ...Towards a Reliable and Accountable Cyber Supply Chain in Energy Delivery System Using BlockchainConference PaperFull-text availableAug 2018International Conference on Security and Privacy in Communication Networks Xueping Liang Sachin Shetty Deepak Tosh Yafei JiDanyi LiThe cyber supply chain arises as the emerging business model of today's IT infrastructure in enterprise-level energy delivery system, which relies on different software or hardware vendors. Due to the heterogeneous services provided and various roles involved for each system entity to maintain the IT infrastructure, the attack surface expands dramatically , thus putting enterprise systems at high risks of data breaches or compromises. This paper firstly presents an overview of the typical cyber supply chain system, including system entities and processes, and then two attack scenarios are illustrated. Following the analysis of cyber supply chain security requirements and countermeasures, we integrate the power of blockchain technology that has a trustless and decentralized architecture, to the cyber supply chain to achieve reliability and accountability. A basic framework for blockchain assured energy delivery system is introduced as a case study to provide guidelines for future blockchain adoption in achieving provenance of cyber supply chain systems in any industries.View... To fully exchange a new message or transaction to all nodes in large networks could take a significant amount of time and delay the consensus process. For example, in an IoT environment where a set of drones are controlled and linked with Blockchain client [10], the propagation delay in blockchain transactions that record drone operations and stated could lead to significant delay in the future control and communication with the drones. The timely propagation of control messages to the drones adds to the resilience in such application scenarios.  ...... Attribute-based data sharing [25] system can disclose only necessary information to service providers without revealing their real identity and other sensitive information. The combination of channel-based isolation and Intel SGX-based trusted execution is also a feasible way to preserve node privacy [10].  ...Exploring the Attack Surfaces in Blockchain Enabled Smart CitiesConference PaperAug 2018 Xueping Liang Sachin Shetty Deepak ToshWith the development of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology, the notion of smart city concept comes to reality. Smart city covers a broad range of scenarios for citizens in their everyday life, such as smart home, smart traffic and smart healthcare. However, considering the IoT technology itself still under security threats, smart city security and resilience is a critical factor for truly embracing the smart age of everyday life. Current technology has a difficult time providing security in smart city architectures because of its decentralized and distributed nature. As a recently new technology, Blockchain uses a decentralized and distributed security approach to adding security to a decentralized and distributed IoT system. This paper presents a blockchain based solution to provide security and resilience in smart cities and analyze potential security concerns in the integration of blockchain technology into smart city infrastructure. Each of the concerns are discussed in detail.View... The centralizing aspect rests in the Membership Service Provider (MSP) and accompanying Certificate Authority (CA) system. In controlling and dolling out access to the network, the MSP becomes a point of centralization that every actor must go through to interact with the network, such as the application scenarios in healthcare domain [4] and IoT domain [5]. Every sensor in a city wide system is managed by the same administrative persons and while the network itself remains decentralized in a peer to peer fashion, there exists a funnel system in the way read, write, and channel permissions are distributed.  ...Attack Surface Analysis of Permissioned Blockchain Platforms for Smart CitiesConference PaperAug 2018 Amanda Davenport Sachin Shetty Xueping LiangIn this paper, we explore the attack surfaces in open source permissioned blockchain project Hyperledger Fabric that can be exploited and compromised through cryptographic tactics. Attacks such as insider threats, DNS attacks, private key attacks, and certificate authority (CA) attacks are proposed and discussed. Points in transaction flow where the proposed attacks are threats to the permissioned blockchain are specified and analyzed. Key management systems are discussed, and a deep analysis of Hierarchical Deterministic wallets is conducted. The Membership Service Provider (MSP) proves to be a centralizing aspect of an otherwise decentralized system and proves to be a weakness of the permissioned blockchain network.ViewShow moreGet access to 30 million figuresJoin ResearchGate to access over 30 million figures and 118+ million publications – all in one place.Join for freeJoin ResearchGate to find the people and research you need to help your work.15+ million members118+ million publications700k+ research projectsJoin for freeorDiscover by subject areaRecruit researchersJoin for freeLoginEmail Tip: Most researchers use their institutional email address as their ResearchGate loginPasswordForgot password?
