They are expected for some applications: disaster relief, farm field, security field, transportation field, etc. Some companies will employ the autopilot system for their business. However, they have to switch to manual operation in case of emergency due to the autopilot safety is not guaranteed. Therefore, a pilot must connect with the drone continuously by the network for remote monitoring. Cellular network systems are the candidate networks for remote monitoring. However, typical design of cellular networks does not assume user equipment devices in the air because antennas of cellular networks are usually aimed downward to reduce inter-cell interference. This means that drones may fly out a communication area of cellular networks. Therefore, business drones must communicate with some cellular networks to keep continuous communication. However, IP-based application will disconnect due to change of cellular networks. As a result, practical business drones’ operations require a continuous communication mechanism. This paper proposes a continuous remote control architecture for drone operations to improve safety of the autopilot function. The proposed architecture employs NTMobile technology as a seamless mobility protocol supporting continuous communication. Additionally, it also employs IP-based remote control application to control drones remotely. The evaluation system can acquire sensor information and exchange control information continuously when drones switch access networks. The proposed architecture can be a fundamental framework to realize a wide area drone operation service.Discover the world's research15+ million members118+ million publications700k+ research projectsJoin for free Figures - uploaded by Katsuhiro NaitoAuthor contentAll content in this area was uploaded by Katsuhiro NaitoContent may be subject to copyright.

In recent years, drones are being considered for use in variousﬁelds, due to performance improvement and lower price. In particular, itis expected to be used in disaster relief, farm ﬁeld, security ﬁeld, trans-portation ﬁeld. In case of business use, drones make a ﬂight with notmanual but autopilot. However, drone must switch to manual operationin case of emergency due to autopilot safety is not guaranteed. There-fore, pilot must constantly connection with the drone by network forremote monitoring. The drone using the cellular system for long dis-tance communication for remote monitoring has been studied. In thispaper, propose a remote monitoring system for drones that improves thesafety of the autopilot function. Moreover, we solve the problem by usingNTMobile technology that can communicate across multiple networks.The proposed system can acquire sensor information and camera infor-mation without being inﬂuenced by network change accompanying dronemovement. Moreover, the proposed system can remotely operate dronein emergency.Keywords: Wireless sensor networks, Infrared radiation sensors, Fieldobservation , Smart agriculture, TWELITE1 IntroductionIn recent years, drone of small aircraft has been used for various purposes dueto price reduction and performance improvement. Particularly in business uti-lization, the drone is expected to be active in disaster relief, agriculture ﬁeld,security ﬁeld and transportation ﬁeld[?]. In the agriculture ﬁeld, spraying pesti-cides using drone is under consideration. In addition, monitoring of condition ofagricultural crops using high precision cameras and various sensors is also underconsideration[?,?,?]. In the security ﬁeld, systems that detect and track suspi-cious individuals using multiple drone and drone cameras are under considera-tion[?,?]. Furthermore, in the transportation ﬁeld, demonstration experiments




on transportation using drone are being conducted[?,?]. In the above case, auto-matic control using autopilot function is required rather than manual operationusing a general controller.The autopilot function is a function that sets a waypoint indicating the ﬂightpath in advance to the drones and moves the drone according to the waypoint.During the autopilot function, the pilot need not operate the drone. However, theautopilot function may be accompanied by danger due to unexpected behavior ofdrone and environmental changes. Therefore, it is necessary to remotely monitorautopilot function by drone sensor information and camera image. In addition,it is important to be able to switch control of drone into controller operation incase of emergency. Furthermore, the drones and the controller application needto be constantly connected to the network in order to constantly monitor thedrone sensor information.[?].Since the Wireless communication technology used for drones has limitedcommunication range, so reliability and stability of communication cannot beguaranteed when it is used in urban areas. Therefore, a communication methodusing a cellular system is required to realize a wider operation[?]. In recent years,services utilizing a cellular system are under consideration to realize transporta-tion to remote areas using drone.When using the cellular system, the communication quality of each carriervaries depending on the installation situation on the base station. In addition,the communication quality may be degraded locally. Therefore, in order to con-tinuously monitor the drones, it is required to secure an optimum communicationpath at all times by using a plurality of carrier services. However, the currentnetwork has problems such as NAT traversal problem and IP address changedue to network switching. Due to the above problems the connection betweenthe drone and the controller application may be disconnected. In this paper, wesolve the problem by using NTMobile technology that can communicate acrossmultiple networks.[?].In this paper, propose a remote monitoring system for drones that improvesthe safety of the autopilot function. The paper adopts a DJI N3 ﬂight controllerfor ﬂight controller of drone. The N3 can to perform serial communication withthe on-board device, due to N3 has ports for API and CAN2. The on-boarddevice can control the drone by using DJI Onboard SDK. The paper adoptsraspberry pi 3 as the on-board device. Remotely access the raspberry pi froman another computer and remotely control the drone. In this paper, install NT-Mobile on a raspberry pi and a remote access computer for solve the problem ofcommunication disconnection due to NAT traversal in the network and changeof IP address due to switching to the network.2 Drone’s control mechanism2.1 Outline drawing of the droneFigure show ?? a drone system schematic diagram. A drone system consists of aﬂight controller (FC) that controls ﬂight, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)

Outline drawing of the dronethat measures the angle and acceleration of the drone, a barometric pressuresensor that measures altitude, a GPS to locate the position, an Electronic Itconsists of Speed Controller (ESC). The ﬂight controller can Attitude control ofa drone, using the ESC and the IMU. Moreover controls a position of the dronebased on the information of the Global Positioning System (GPS). Similarly, theatmospheric pressure sensor is used as information for maintaining altitude.2.2 Remote control methodControl over the wireless The frequency band used by the controller is 2.4GHz band and 5 GHz band. The 5 GHz band need a license of amateur radio foruse. The 2.4 GHz band no need license for use, therefore general users often useto 2.4 GHz. In the controller using the 2.4 GHz communication use to spreadspectrum technology such as FASST, S-FHSS and DMSS for the stability ofcommunication.Controller and receiver assign signals to each channel and communicate. Thecontroller must be able to be allocated more than 4 ch to control the drone, dueto drone control need throttle, pitch, yaw, and roll. Communication betweenthe receiver and the motor is performed by wired communication. The wiredcommunication control method is as follows.1. PWM :PWM is an analog signal that performs on/oﬀ switching and controlsoutput power.A single cable can process one signal.PWM has been used forradio control for a long time.2. PPM :PPM can control eight motors with one signal line.3. Serial :Serial is a digital signal.S.BUS, MSP and XBUS exist.S.BUS can use18 channels of signal with one cable.



4. S.BUS2:S.BUS 2 is an extension of S. BUS. Supports a telemetry systemsystem that sends drone sensor information and remaining battery powerfrom the receiver to the controller.Control over the IP network The method of using the IP network is com-monly used like the controller. A controller that uses an IP network is usually anapplication on a smartphone. The pilot connects the drone and the smartphoneto be the controller with WiFi and operates. In general, when using a smart-phone, use the button displayed on the screen to operate. There is a merit thatthere is no need to have a large controller. However there is a disadvantage thatthe ﬂying distance is short compared to the controller.The controller application of the smartphone can receive and display thesensor information of the drone and the remaining battery level. In addition,from a camera mounted on the drone, can see the video in real time, the operatoris able to steer the drone while watching the video. Currently, many drone usesthe WiFi module, establishes the controller and the local network and connects.2.3 Operation managementManual control Manual operation by the controller is a general operationmethod of the drone.The controller has two joysticks. Joysticks performs an operation of throt-tle, pitch, yaw and roll. There are also several other buttons, and it is possibleto assign operations other than basic operations such as gimbal operation onthe drone, shooting button of the camera, takeoﬀ and the like. When the dronereceives the command from the controller, the ﬂight controller operates the ser-vomotor and moves. While not receiving instructions from the controller, thedrone automatically maintains its current position from GPS and sensor infor-mation.Currently, as the performance of drone ﬂight controller improves. Therefore,the pilot can do an unmanned ﬂight without considering subtle attitude manip-ulation and wind inﬂuence. Also, the basic operation is from controller, there isa method to check the camera image mounted on the drones with WiFi and thesmartphone application.Autopilot The autopilot function is a ﬂight method in which the pilot doesnot need to operate the drone. For this reason, even people who can not due toa drone maneuver can use it.With the auto pilot function, it is necessary to set waypoints before ﬂyingthe drone. The waypoint indicates the ﬂight path of the drone. The waypointcontains latitude, longitude and altitude information. Moreover, it is also possibleto take a speciﬁc action, such as take oﬀ and landing, the camera shooting inthe waypoint. Even in ﬂight with automatic piloting function it is possible tosend sensor information to the pilot within the range of communication using atelemetry system.



 Remote operation and remote monitoring of the drone. Drone switches the network according to communication quality.Base station A Base station BCellular networkInternetHand overFig. 2. Proposed systemIn order to realize these, the drone controls the drone based on the infor-mation of the GPS sensor mounted on the drone. Therefore, it can not be usedin places where GPS such as indoor can not be acquired. Due to solve theseproblems, methods for determining obstacles using infrared rays and camerasare being studied.3 Proposed systemFigure ?? shows the proposed system model diagram of this paper. In this paper,we propose an unmanned remote control system and a remote monitoring systemusing a cellular system. The drone is equipped with communication modules ofmultiple cellular systems rather than traditional communication modules. Byusing the cellular system for drone communication, it is possible to communicateover longer distances than of the conventional communication system. However,a single cellular system the radio wave condition is not stable depending on thelocation. Therefore, in this paper use multiple cellular systems to improve thestability of communication.Though there is a problem that the communication is disconnected becausethe network to which it belongs is switched. In this paper use NTMobile tech-nology to solve this problem. Section ?? shows about NTMobile.3.1 NTMobileNTMobile is a network architecture that can simultaneously satisfy the mobilityon various networks and the connectivity externally connected to terminals ex-isting under NAT. Figure ?? shows the network diagram supposed by NTMobile.NTMobile consists of four elements, a NTMobile node (NTM node) equipped

In recent years, drones have been employed for precision agriculture monitoring at smaller scales, and for past few decades, satellite data are being used for land cover classification and agriculture monitoring at larger scales. The monitoring of agriculture precisely over a large scale is a challenging task. In this paper, an approach has been proposed for precision agriculture monitoring, i.e., the classification of sparse and dense fields, which is carried out using freely available satellite data (Landsat 8) along with drone data. Repeated usage of drone has to be minimized and hence an adaptive classification approach is developed, which works with image statistics of the selected region. The proposed approach is successfully tested and validated on different spatial and temporal Landsat 8 data.ViewShow abstractA new approach to realize drone swarm using ad-hoc networkConference PaperJun 2017 Omar ShritSteven MartinKhaldoun Alagha Guy PujolleViewThe influence of drone monitoring on crop health and harvest sizeConference PaperJul 2017Marthinus Reinecke Tania PrinslooViewRouting protocols for video surveillance drones in IEEE 802.11s Wireless Mesh NetworksConference PaperJun 2017 Charles jumaa Katila Antonio Di Gianni Chiara Buratti R. VerdoneIn this paper we consider a video surveillance application, using a camera mounted on a drone flying over the area to be monitored and sending the video to a control center (CC). In order to ensure connectivity between the drone and the CC some relays are deployed on the ground. The resulting network is composed of a static component (relays), and a moving component (the drone). All network devices are assumed to be equipped with IEEE 802.11s air interfaces. The goal of our work is to design and validate a routing protocol appropriate for this scenario. The IEEE 802.11s standard proposes Hybrid Wireless Mesh routing Protocol (HWMP) composed of a proactive tree-based routing and the reactive Radio Metric Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (RM-AODV) scheme to support mesh networks. To address the need for reliable connectivity, faster and resource-efficient path discovery, we envisage a mixed optimized scheme, called Optimized-Hybrid Wireless Mesh Protocol (O-HWMP), where both, RM-AODV and the proactive tree-based scheme, are used at the same time. In O-HWMP the output of the tree-based routing scheme provides input to the RM-AODV, in order to reduce flooding of control packets, and to minimize delays during path discovery. Through NS3-Evalvid simulations we demonstrate that, compared to RM-AODV scheme, our proposed protocol significantly improves network performance in terms of delays, packet success rate, overhead cost, and peak-signal-to-noise-ratio metric of the received video.ViewShow abstractA service-oriented Cloud-based management system for the Internet-of-DronesConference PaperApr 2017 Anis Koubaa Basit Qureshi Mohamed-Foued Sriti Eduardo TovarViewRadio Channel Modeling for UAV Communication Over Cellular NetworksArticleMay 2017 Rafhael M.

In this pursuit, field measurements were conducted in live LTE networks at the 800 MHz frequency band, using a commercial UAV. Our results show that path loss exponent decreases as the UAV moves up, approximating freespace propagation for horizontal ranges up to tens of kilometers at UAV heights around 100m. Our findings support the need of heightdependent parameters for describing the propagation channel for UAVs at different heights.ViewShow abstractSensor drone for aerial odor mapping for agriculture and security servicesConference PaperFull-text availableJun 2016 Theerapat Pobkrut Tanthip Eamsa-ard Teerakiat KerdcharoenViewProposal of seamless IP mobility schemes: Network traversal with mobility (NTMobile)Conference PaperDec 2012 Katsuhiro Naito Takuya Nishio Kazuo Mori Akira WatanabeIP mobility is the technology that realizes a continuous communication even when communicating wireless nodes switch access networks. NTMobile (Network Traversal with Mobility) is a new type of IP mobility technology for the IPv4 and IPv6 networks. NTMobile nodes can also achieve IP mobility in global IP networks as well as in private IP networks by creating a tunnel route between a pair of NTMobile nodes. In NTMobile, network applications use virtual IP addresses to achieve a continuous communication at the time when real IP addresses change due to the switching of access networks or node movements.
