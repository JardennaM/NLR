Introduction Research and development of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and micro aerial vehicle (MAV) are getting high encouragement nowadays, since the application of UAV and MAV can apply to variety of area such as rescue mission, military, film making, agriculture and others. In US Coast Guard maritime search and rescue mission, UAV that attached with infrared cameras assist the mis- sion to search the target [1]. Quadcopter or quad rotor aircraft is one of the UAV that is major focuses of ac- tive researches in recent years. Compare to terrestrial mobile robot that often possible to limit the model to kinematics, Quadcopter required dynamics in order to account for gravity effect and aerodynamic forces [2]. Quadcopter operated by thrust that produce by four mo- tors that attached to it body. It has four input force and six output states (x, y, z, θ, ψ, ω) and it is an under-ac- tuated system, since this enable Quadcopter to carry more load [3]. Quadcopter has the advantages over the conventional helicopter where the mechanical design is simpler. Besides that, Quadcopter changes direction by manipulating the individual propeller’s speed and does not require cyclic and collective pitch control [3,4]. 2. Related Work Nowadays, studies on UAV has attracted researchers and academia due to its broad of applications. One kind of UAV is Quadcopter. The research related to Quadcopter covers the areas of design, control, stability, communica- tion systems and collision avoidance. The using of GUI for controlling of Quadcopter has been widely used. Reference [5] studied on designing GUI control of UAV based on genetic algorithm (GA). The GUI developed is multi remote control and multi button. Reference [6] learned GUI control of Quadcopter for test purpose. The GUI is analyzed using GA. Reference [7] investigated GUI for convenient detection and control of the leak bottle detection equipment and embedded in ARM processor. Reference [8] focused their study on the 3-DOF attitude control free-flying vehicle. The characteristic to be heavily coupled with inputs and outputs, and the serious non-linearity appear in the flying vehicle and due to this non-linear control, multi variable control or opti- mal control for the attitude control of flying Quadcopter. Reference [9] developed of nonlinear model and non- linear control strategy for a 6-DOF Quadcopter aerial robot. The nonlinear model of Quadcopter aerial robot is Copyright © 2013 SciRes. IJCNS 




D. HANAFI    ET  AL. 53based on Newton-Euler formalism. Model derivation comprises determining equations of motion of the Quad- copter in three dimensions and seeking to approximate actuation forces through modeling of the aerodynamic coefficients and electric motor dynamics. Reference [10] is done research on control of Quadcopter by visual tracking using stereo camera. The motion of a Quad- copter is control based on visual feedback and measure- ment of inertial sensor. In this research, active markers were finely designed to improve visibility under various perspectives. Figure 1 is the structure of Quadcopter controller done in this research. Reference [11] worked on intelligent fuzzy controller of Quadcopter. A fuzzy control is designed and implemented to control a simulation model of the Quad- copter. The inputs are the desired values of the height, roll, pitch and yaw. The outputs are the power of each of the four rotors that is necessary to reach the specifications. Simu- lation results prove the efficiency of this intelligent control strategy. Reference [12,13] is done research to analyze the dynamic characteristics and PID controller performance of a Quadcopter. This paper is describe the architecture of Quad- copter and analyzes the dynamic model on it. Besides that, this paper also designs a controller which aim to regulate the posture (position and orientation) of the 6-DOF Quadcopter. 3. Quadcopter Model In this paper the frame of Quadcopter is build using alu- minum plate. It is two layer of shape aluminum plate and connects together with bolts and nuts as this will make the frame of the Quadcopter become rigid and light- weight. Weight of the Quadcopter is propor-tional with it hover ability. Less weight will increase hover ability of it with minimum power consu n. This Quadcopter frame consist of a minimum area that just enough to place all the parts such as motor, controller board and batteries. Figure 2 shows Quadcopter frame     Figure 1.

In this work the GUI is design for com- municating tools between the human as operator and Quadcopter movement. The command as input of the Quadcopter controller will be inputted by the operator through GUI. There are four movements of Quadcopter that will control. They are throttle for altitude movement, rudder for yaw movement, aileron for roll movement, and elevator for pitch movement. Figure 6 describes the Quadcopter GUI controller develops.   Figure 6.

The data is inputted using GUI and consist of throttle for altitude movement, rudder for yaw movement, aileron for roll movement, and elevator for pitch movement as in Figure 2. From GUI, data is transmitted to transmitter at computer and received by receiver at Quadcopter. Based on that data controller send command signals to Quadcopter propeller and Quad- copter responses are sensed using ultrasonic sensor and gyro to ensure achievement of controller objectives.

The controller parameters are proportional gain K, integral time  iT, and derivative time  dT. In general form the PID algorithm can be represented by the trans-fer function below: The PID controller was applied since it is one type of widely used controller [17]. The PID controller is the most common form of feedback. The PID controllers are today found in all areas where a control is used. Their useful functions are sufficient for a large number of pro- cess applications and the transparency of the features leads to wide acceptance by the users. On the other hand, it can be shown that the internal mode control (IMC) framework leads to PID controllers for virtually all mod- els common in practice [17,18].

VasiljevViewFlight Stability Analysis of a Symmetrically-Structured Quadcopter Based on Thrust Data Logger InformationArticleFull-text availableJul 2018 Endrowednes Kuantama Ioan Constantin TarcaSimona Dzitac Radu Catalin TarcaQuadcopter flight stability is achieved when all of the rotors-propellers generate equal thrust in hover and throttle mode. It requires a control system algorithm for rotor speed adjustment, which is related with the translational vector and rotational angle. Even with an identical propeller and speed, the thrusts generated are not necessarily equal on all rotors-propellers. Therefore, this study focuses on developing a data logger to measure thrust and to assist in flight control on a symmetrically-structured quadcopter. It is developed with a four load cells sensor with two-axis characterizations and is able to perform real-time signal processing. The process includes speed adjustment for each rotor, trim calibration, and a proportional integral derivative (PID) control tuning system. In the data retrieval process, a quadcopter was attached with data logger system in a parallel axis position. Various speeds between 1200 rpm to 4080 rpm in throttle mode were analyzed to determine the stability of the resulting thrust. Adjustment result showed that the thrust differences between the rotors were less than 0.5 N. The data logger showed the consistency of the thrust value and was proved by repeated experiments with 118 s of sampling time for the same quadcopter control condition. Finally, the quadcopter flight stability as the result of tuning process by the thrust data logger was validated by the flight controller data.ViewShow abstractReview of the Control System for an Unmanned Underwater Remotely Operated VehicleChapterJan 2018 Ahmad Makarimi AbdullahNursyahida Izzati ZakariaKhairul Arief Abu JalilMohd Iqram Mohd KamroThis paper presents a review of control system algorithms for unmanned underwater remotely operated vehicles (ROV), focusing on the proportional integral derivative (PID) controller and fuzzy logic lontroller (FLC).

Landmines were primarily used to create defensive and tactical barriers during the Second World War. They are still very much employed in large quantities in countries such as Afghanistan, Korea. A lot of these land mines still go undetected, increasing the death rate and creating havoc on the surroundings. The prototype developed helps us to detect a landmine using a flying drone. The prototype has a quad copter which has a mine detector mounted on it. This utilizes two different modes of detection, which are an IR camera and a metal detector. These are extensively used in aiding this whole operation. The location of the mine can be traced back by the GPS and the detected location can be transmitted using the GSM module. There is a lot of untapped potential and scope of improvement for this prototype in the future. In this paper, we have successfully worked on a mine detector that performs functions of vested interest towards the military and commercial organizations.ViewShow abstractA real-time assessment approach to quadrotor flight control capabilityArticleFull-text availableSep 2014Bin Liu Zhiyao ZhaoBinxian YangKai-Yuan CaiTo solve the problem for the online assessment of the quadrotor flight control capability, this paper proposes a novel definition of control capability, and an approach to assess the control capability online. A quadrotor fault model is presented firstly, and the real-time fault detection is implemented using an Extended Kalman filter. Then, the function fitting method is used to achieve real-time controlability calculation by obtaining the relation between the controllability and the estimated fault vector. Finally, the online assessment of control capability is achieved by the integration of the controllability and the performance factor of the control law.

CroweD. GreenwoodThe effectiveness of proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers for a large class of process systems has ensured their continued and widespread use in industry. Similarly there has been a continued interest from academia in devising new ways of approaching the PID tuning problem. To the industrial engineer and many control academics this work has previously appeared fragmented; but a key determinant of this literature is the type of process model information used in the PID tuning methods. PID Control presents a set of coordinated contributions illustrating methods, old and new, that cover the range of process model assumptions systematically. After a review of PID technology, these contributions begin with model-free methods, progress through non-parametric model methods (relay experiment and phase-locked-loop procedures), visit fuzzy-logic- and genetic-algorithm-based methods; introduce a novel subspace identification method before closing with an interesting set of parametric model techniques including a chapter on predictive PID controllers. Highlights of PID Control include: an introduction to PID control technology features and typical industrial implementations; chapter contributions ordered by the increasing quality of the model information used; novel PID control concepts for multivariable processes. PID Control will be useful to industry-based engineers wanting a better understanding of what is involved in the steps to a new generation of PID controller techniques. Academics wishing to have a broader perspective of PID control research and development will find useful pedagogical material and research ideas in this text.ViewShow abstractFlight PID controller design for a UAV quadrotorArticleJan 2010SCI RES ESSAYS Atheer L Salih Mahmoud MoghavvemiHaider A. F. Mohamed Khalaf GaeidThis paper presents the modeling of a four rotor vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) unmanned air vehicle known as the quad rotor aircraft. The paper presents a new model design method for the flight control of an autonomous quad rotor. The paper describes the controller architecture for the quad rotor as well. The dynamic model of the quad-rotor, which is an under actuated aircraft with fixed four pitch angle rotors was described. The Modeling of a quad rotor vehicle is not an easy task because of its complex structure. The aim is to develop a model of the vehicle as realistic as possible. The model is used to design a stable and accurate controller. This paper explains the developments of a PID (proportional-integral-derivative) control method to obtain stability in flying the Quad-rotor flying object. The model has four input forces which are basically the thrust provided by each propeller connected to each rotor with fixed angle. Forward (backward) motion is maintained by increasing (decreasing) speed of front (rear) rotor speed while decreasing (increasing) rear (front) rotor speed simultaneously which means changing the pitch angle. Left and right motion is accomplished by changing roll angle by the same way. The front and rear motors rotate counterclockwise while other motors rotate clockwise so that the yaw command is derived by increasing (decreasing) counterclockwise motors speed while decreasing (increasing) clockwise motor speeds.ViewShow abstractDesign and realization of GUI-control for leak detection equipmentConference PaperSep 2011Luyong SunHengheng XieKai ChenFor the demand of convenient detection and control of the leak bottle detection equipment, the embedded GUI detection and control module is designed and realized based on the ARM processor and embedded Linux OS by utilizing MiniGUI in accordance with characteristics of the equipment.

Karl HedrickUnmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can assist in U.S. Coast Guard maritime search and rescue missions by flying in formation with a manned helicopter while using infrared cameras to search the water for targets. Current search and rescue flight patterns contain abrupt turns that can be achieved by a helicopter but not by a fixed-wing UAV. Therefore, a necessity for UAV-assisted search and rescue is path planning and control that allows a UAV to track a helicopter performing such maneuvers while maintaining the desired sensor coverage and the safety of all aircraft. A feasible path planning algorithm combined with an off the shelf autopilot system is proposed. The path planning algorithm consists of four modes, each with an associated domain of application. Each mode is formulated to provide safety and contiguous sensor coverage between the UAV and the helicopter. For each of a series of k corners, the along-track distance between the vehicles is defined as L(k). By representing the path planner as a finite automaton, it is shown that any execution of the system causes the series {L(k)} to converge to zero, thereby resulting in satisfactory tracking. Simulations were performed with a non-linear UAV model and a commercial autopilot system in the control loop. In these simulations, the desired trajectories were commanded to the autopilot as a series of waypoints. However, the UAV was unable to accurately track the desired trajectories, resulting in oscillatory paths with unpredictable lengths.ViewShow abstractShow moreJoin ResearchGate to find the people and research you need to help your work.15+ million members118+ million publications700k+ research projectsJoin for freeRecommendationsDiscover more publications, questions and projects in QuadcopterProjectMY PROJECT IS Development of intelligent identification algorithm for nonlinear systems Tatang Tatang Mulyana Dirman Hanafi Mohamad NOR HaziqView projectArticleFull-text availableLow-Cost Bluetooth-Arduino Hover Control Design of a Quad CopterAugust 2016 Supantha Mandal Suraj Kumar SawKaran Shaw[...]Puja SinghThis paper presents bluetooth controlled arduino integrated with collision detection, avoidance and contol features which provides the unique ability of flight stablization, hover contol and landing features in any terrain.The extremely sophistcated design provides very good hover contol of the design.The design integrated with ultrasonic sensors with in built accelerometer controls the speed and ...
