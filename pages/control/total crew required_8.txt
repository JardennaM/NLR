REGULATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS STATEMENT 
(This statement is not part of the Regulations.)
Executive summary 

Issues: The growing Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS or RPA) industry has significant economic potential. However, the existing Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs) do not provide a regulatory framework that promotes the economic potential of RPAS nor does it contain modern, risk- and performance-based regulations that can uphold aviation safety. To date, Transport Canada (TC) has been overseeing commercial RPAS operations on a case-by-case basis using certain CARs provisions that were not designed specifically for RPAS in order to mitigate aviation safety risks. This approach is complex, inefficient, and in some cases overly restrictive. Recreational operations must comply with the Interim Order established temporarily by the Minister of Transport to address risks to aviation and people. In the absence of regulatory change, risks to aviation and public safety will continue to rise in step with the growth in popularity of RPAS.
Description: The amendments to the CARs will reduce the number of operations that require Special Flight Operations Certificates (SFOC) for remotely piloted aircraft with a maximum take-off weight between 250 g and 25 kg and operated within visual line-of-sight (VLOS). The amendments will reduce risks to public safety through pilot certification and will also introduce RPAS safety-based manufacturing requirements intended for certain operations.
Cost-benefit statement: The monetized benefits include the elimination of SFOC and a reduced risk to public safety; they will bring an estimated benefit of $144.5 million over 2018–2029 (present value discounted 7% and expressed in $CAD 2018). Costs are expected to be $172.9 million over the same period, leading to an overall monetized net cost of $28.4 million. Additional non-monetized benefits include a reduced risk to aviation safety and greater predictability for commercial operations.
“One-for-One” Rule and small business lens: The “One-for-One” Rule applies and is a net OUT of $5.8 million, or $350 per business because the SFOC application process will be replaced by less costly requirements (expressed in $CAD 2012 present value, annualized over 2018–2028, and discounted 7%). Moreover, the Regulations bring a net reduction of $35.6 million in small businesses costs and introduces flexibility and efficiencies including an online portal to process registrations and exams, and to issue pilot certificates.
Domestic and international coordination and cooperation: Transport Canada has collaborated with the United States (U.S.) Federal Aviation Administration since 2015 under the Regulatory Cooperation Council. The focus is largely based on information sharing and best practices regarding RPAS regulatory development and implementation, and both parties have taken similar approaches to regulating RPAS.
Background 
Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS), also referred to as drones, is a growing industry in Canada. This is largely driven by a number of global and domestic trends, including rapid technological advancement, increasing availability of drones at a low cost, and a broad industry in which a drone could facilitate work tasks more efficiently than traditional aviation or more safely than workers exposing themselves to risk of falls or other hazards. Operational drone services are expanding for a number of applications such as aerial photography, surveying, building inspections, ice reconnaissance, law enforcement, disaster response, traffic patterns, road repair, research and development, and much more.
Drones can be referred to by various names; however, Transport Canada uses the technical term Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems
footnote 2 when referring to drones. The term RPAS is gender neutral and indicates the fact that the pilot controls the device remotely.
The number of RPAS flown in Canada is estimated to be 193 500. By comparison, it is estimated that there are 37 000 aircraft in traditional aviation, including commercial passenger and cargo aircraft and general aviation aircraft. The growth of this new industry has brought new entrants to aviation. Transport Canada is no longer solely dealing with the typical industries, such as aerospace manufacturers, airlines and airplane pilots. New entrants include commercial RPAS operators, manufacturers, training providers, law enforcement, and academia. Unlike persons who are traditionally involved in aviation, such as commercial airline pilots and military pilots, the new entrants have varying levels of aviation safety awareness, may never have flown traditional aircraft before, and may be unfamiliar with safety-related aviation rules and regulations.
Canadian civil aviation is the responsibility of the Minister of Transport under the Aeronautics Act (the Act). Under the Act the Minister is responsible for the development of regulations governing aeronautics and the supervision of all matters connected with aeronautics. However, there is currently no specific set of rules in place to require the safe operation of RPAS in Canada. Currently, under the Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs) made under the Act, remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) can be defined as either model aircraft, which are aircraft launched into flight for recreational purposes, or unmanned air vehicles that are used for non-recreational purposes. Regarding model aircraft, the CARs
footnote 3 require that no person fly an aircraft into cloud or in a manner that is or is likely hazardous to aviation safety. Under Part VI of the CARs,
footnote 4 special flight operations involving RPAS that are flown for 
non-recreational purposes (i.e. work or research) are subject to certain conditions that are set out in a Special Flight Operations Certificate (SFOC).
footnote 5
Flying an RPA has become a common pastime. The recreational RPAS community is estimated at 140 800 operators in 2018 with a projected increase to 225 500 operators by 2025.
footnote 6 That being said, the minimal requirements under the CARs for recreational pilots have resulted in a number of incidents (which are often associated with a lack of user knowledge) resulting in a growing risk to aviation safety as well as to people on the ground. Since 2014, the number of RPAS-related incidents
footnote 7 reported to Transport Canada has risen over 200%. Incidents have included risks to traditional aircraft while they are on take-off or landing near airports, high altitude flights, and risk of injury to people on the ground caused by events such as a fly-away, which generally means that a pilot cannot maintain control of the RPA or that it ceases to follow pre-programmed procedures. In 2017, the Minister of Transport made an Interim Order (IO) under the Act to address the growing number of incidents. The objective of the IO was to improve aviation safety, to protect the public and to ensure the safe operation of certain model aircraft. It is a temporary measure (renewed in June 2018) until new regulations are in place to require the safe operation of RPAS.
Issues 
The growing RPAS industry has significant economic potential; however, non-recreational operators face considerable administrative burden and uncertainty under the existing rules, which require operators to hold SFOC. Moreover, an RPA flown recklessly or by inexperienced pilots pose risks to aviation and public safety that must be mitigated. An increase in aviation and non-aviation-related incidents has been observed, particularly surrounding operations near and over people as well as in controlled airspace. To date, Transport Canada has been making use of existing regulatory mechanisms in the CARs and legislative mechanisms under the Act (SFOC and IO) to address these risks. However, the current rules are complex, time consuming, and in some cases overly restrictive. In the absence of regulatory change, risks to aviation and public safety will continue to rise in step with the growth in popularity of RPAS. Additionally, the SFOC requirements were not designed for the increasing volume and use of RPAS and will continue to be costly for businesses and introduce unnecessary unpredictability for this emerging innovative industry. In order to effectively address these issues, a modern, risk- and performance-based regulatory environment is required.
Objectives 
These amendments have two main objectives:

Regulatory predictability for businesses
 To move away from the case-by-case treatment of non-recreational RPAS operations by eliminating a number SFOC requirements for VLOS operations. This will create a predictable and flexible regulatory environment conducive to long-term planning while reducing costly administrative burdens on businesses.
Safety risk mitigation 
To reduce the risks to aviation safety and to people caused by the unsafe operation of RPAS, by ensuring that pilots have a relevant knowledge base.
These amendments introduce service fees for RPAS operators. These fees recover some of Transport Canada’s costs of administering the RPAS registration, examination, and certification programs.
Description 
These amendments introduce a new Part IX to the CARs that establish rules for all RPA weighing between 250 grams (g) and 25 kilograms (kg), as well as a general provision that prohibits RPA of any weight to be flown in a negligent or reckless manner. The weight threshold refers to the maximum take-off weight of the aircraft; it does not include the weight of the system used to control the aircraft. These amendments establish risk-based rules that mitigate the safety risks of RPAS through requirements for the pilot, the product (i.e. the RPAS) and the procedures to follow. The rules are divided into two areas: “basic operations” and “advanced operations.” The rules governing basic operations apply to the operation of RPAS outside of controlled airspace and more than 30 m away from people. The rules governing advanced operations apply to operations in controlled airspace, near people (between 30 m and 5 m of people), flying over people (less than 5 m from people), and within 3 nautical miles (NM) from the centre of an airport or within one NM from the centre of a heliport.
While Part IX of the CARs applies to all RPAS, members of the Model Aeronautics Association of Canada (MAAC) operating at MAAC fields and MAAC sanctioned events will be issued an exemption to certain provisions of the CARs. Under the Act,
footnote 8 the Minister has the authority to issue exemptions to the CARs; the exemption will be issued to MAAC before the end of the coming into force of the Regulations.
The pilot 
Part IX of the CARs requires a pilot to be a minimum of 14 years old to conduct basic operations, and a minimum of 16 years old to conduct advanced operations. A certified pilot may supervise someone under the minimum age or someone who has not yet obtained their certificate as long as they meet the certification requirements for the operation being carried out.
As part of the certification process, all pilots are required to successfully complete a knowledge exam to obtain their pilot certificate. Pilots conducting basic operations must successfully complete the Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems — Basic Operations online exam to obtain their pilot certificate. Whereas pilots who are operating under the advanced operations must complete the Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems — Advanced Operations online exam, and subsequently complete a flight review with a flight reviewer who is affiliated with a training provider identified by Transport Canada before obtaining their pilot certificate. During the flight review, pilots must physically demonstrate their ability to operate their RPAS and describe the necessary steps and procedures to have a safe flight. After the successful completion of the flight review, the pilot can obtain their advanced pilot certificate. Within every 24 months of the preceding flight, pilots must meet education recency requirements which can consist of training, flight reviews delivered by a third party or recurrent training activities offered by Transport Canada.
The product 
Manufacturer requirements 
Under Part IX of the CARs, Transport Canada is introducing a requirement for manufacturers to declare that they have met Standard 922 — RPAS Safety Assurance (the Standard). More specifically, manufacturers whose products are intended to fly in advanced operations must self-declare to Transport Canada whether their RPAS model meets the Standard. The declaration can be made at any time to Transport Canada once the manufacturer has verified that the RPAS meets the technical and documentation requirements (i.e. safety targets), using the self-declaration form available in the Standard. Moreover, manufacturers must provide items such as instructions to consumers on how to operate their RPAS model safely. Manufacturers are not required to present test documentation to Transport Canada and receive approval before making a RPAS model available for purchase in Canada. However, they are required to provide Transport Canada with the test documentation to corroborate the safety assurance should it be requested.
RPAS models that have been previously identified on Transport Canada’s compliant RPAS list are grandfathered for the lifespan of the aircraft for operations near people (between 30 m and 5 m from people) and in controlled airspace. Given the higher risk of flying over people (less than 5 m from people), there is no grandfathering of existing compliant RPAS for this type of operation.
Registration requirements 
A pilot may not operate an RPA (weighing between 250 g and 25 kg) unless it is registered with Transport Canada. Following an application, a certificate of registration, including a registration number, is generated using an online automated system. The certificate is issued to the registered owner of the aircraft and the registration number must be affixed to the aircraft before flying.

The procedures (Permissions, restrictions and obligations) 
Permissions and restrictions 
RPA, regardless of whether they are used to conduct basic or advanced operations, must, for example remain below 400 feet above ground level (AGL). There are no speed limits, but it is prohibited for a person to operate an RPA in a manner that is reckless or negligent.
The amendments establish different rules for airports and aerodromes. Remotely piloted aircraft must stay three NM away from the centre of an airport or from the centre of an aerodrome under the authority of the Minister of National Defence, and one NM away from the centre of a heliport. However, if an established procedure has been identified by the Minister for a specific airport, the pilot may follow that procedure which may allow them to fly closer than three NM. Information regarding established procedures will be available on the Canada.ca drone safety web pages. All pilots (conducting advanced or basic operations) flying near aerodromes must not fly in a manner that could interfere with an aircraft operating in the established traffic pattern.
Other operations, such as night flight with proper lighting, and flying multiple remotely piloted aircraft (e.g. a maximum of five) from one control station is permitted.
Records 
The CARs require all owners to keep records regarding each flight, and any maintenance, repair or modification performed on their RPAS. All flight records must be retained for a period of 12 months, while records regarding system mandatory actions, repairs and modifications must be kept for 24 months.

Regulatory and non-regulatory options considered

When considering regulatory and non-regulatory options, it was necessary for Transport Canada to examine options available to address the challenges related to both recreational and non-recreational operations.
Non-regulatory approach supported by an interim order
With respect to recreational users, Transport Canada launched a series of non-regulatory approaches such as education and awareness activities by way of the publication of more information on Transport Canada’s website, greater use of social media messaging and partnerships with retailers to spread education materials. Despite these efforts, Transport Canada continued to witness an increased number of incidents involving predominantly recreational users. Therefore, greater regulatory intervention was required, which resulted in the Minister of Transport making an IO under the Act in March 2017 which included more restrictive requirements for recreational RPAS operations. Following the making of the IO, Transport Canada noted a 9% reduction in the number of RPAS-related incidents despite the ongoing and sustained growth of the industry.
Recognizing the nature of the IO as a temporary instrument and the restrictive nature of its conditions, Transport Canada considers a more permissive regulatory approach that enables recreational operations within the confines of appropriate regulatory requirements to be more reasonable. These amendments provide a means for greater recreational operations.
Status quo regulatory approach
With respect to non-recreational operations, the growing use of RPAS and the requirement for a SFOC for every operation was not sustainable. Transport Canada could not keep pace with the demands, the industry could not innovate as freely, economic opportunities were lost, and frustration with the status quo was creating an environment of non-compliance.
In an effort to mitigate demands for SFOC and enable lower-risk operations, Transport Canada published two exemptions for RPAS
footnote 9 being flown for work or research purposes if the pilot had liability insurance, had read and understood the conditions of the exemptions, and had notified the department before flying. The exemptions were divided into two categories: RPA of 1 kg or less, and RPA weighing between 1 kg and 25 kg. Although this approach provided some benefits and reduced the need for some SFOC, the ongoing growth in the industry and the demands for operations in more advanced environments demonstrated the need for more action.
Transport Canada further examined how SFOC are issued and introduced a series of policy changes to move away from the case-by-case basis of SFOC to the issuance of regional and national SFOC for proven and compliant operators. Although this has assisted in removing some regulatory burden and enabled greater and more routine commercial operations, operators still face administrative burden, delays and uncertainty under this system. A new, modernized and national regulatory framework was needed to fully unlock the potential of the industry.
The longstanding regulatory requirement for a SFOC coupled with the commercial nature of these operations made a voluntary approach not a viable option.
Benefits and costs 
The amendments will reduce the risks to public safety and reduce the business costs associated with applying for SFOC. The monetized benefits from this regulatory proposal are estimated to be $144.5 million over 2018–2029 (present value, discounted 7% and expressed in $CAN 2018). The associated administrative and compliance costs borne by non-recreational and recreational RPAS pilots, Canadian RPAS manufacturers, and the government are expected to be about $172.9 million over the same period.
Taking monetized costs and benefits together, the quantified present value of net costs is $28.4 million over 2018–2029, or an annualized average of $3.8 million ($CAN 2018, discounted 7%). However, there are many additional non-monetized benefits, notably from reduced risks to traditional aviation and the consistency and certainty the regulations will provide to non-recreational operations, allowing them to make long-term plans and commitments more easily.
Given the uncertainty that this emerging technology presents, several scenarios and probability distributions accompany the estimates and assumptions presented in this analysis. A sensitivity analysis incorporates these different assumption scenarios and variations, and is presented later in this statement.
The results of the cost-benefit analysis presented herein reflect the changes made to the amendments since their publication in the Canada Gazette, Part I,
footnote 10 which were adjusted based on stakeholder feedback and updated to capture the latest industry forecasts for this quickly evolving technology. Moreover, changes to the Transport Canada user fee schedule for registration, testing, and certification activities have reduced costs for users considerably, especially those operating in advanced environments. A detailed cost-benefit analysis report is available upon request.
Analytical framework
The costs and benefits of the amendments have been assessed in accordance with the Treasury Board Secretariat’s Cost-Benefit Analysis Guide.
footnote 11 The cost-benefit analysis attempts to capture the economic and social impacts of the regulatory changes (the policy scenario) relative to a world in which these changes did not occur (baseline scenario), pinpointing the incremental changes between the two scenarios. These incremental changes are estimated over 2018–2029 to account for the rapid adoption of the technology and the full impacts of the Regulations. Monetized values are reported in present values over 2018–2029, discounted at 7% and expressed in $CAN 2018 unless otherwise noted.
The baseline scenario includes the requirements currently found in the CARs. Specifically, under CARs non-recreational pilots require a SFOC in order to operate (sections 602.41 and 603.66), while recreational users are required to operate in a way that is not likely to be hazardous to aviation safety (section 602.45).
footnote 12
RPAS population estimates and forecast 
RPAS are a rapidly growing technology, therefore forecasting the RPAS population in Canada involves considerable uncertainty. Indeed, many of the uses for this technology have yet to be discovered or commercialized. For these reasons, the analysis includes three different RPAS population growth scenarios: low, base, and high. These follow the three scenarios developed by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) latest forecast publication.
footnote 13 The cost-benefit analysis assumes that Canada’s RPAS population reflects its total population relative to the U.S., which stood at 11% in 2017.
footnote 14
In all three RPAS population scenarios, the initial growth continues to be rapid in the near term before slowing down in the outer years of the forecast (following a typical trajectory for emerging technologies). The base-case forecast scenario has the RPAS population growing threefold between 2017 and 2029, from 133 100 units to 406 200 units (see Chart 1).

Chart 1: Canada’s RPAS population (Thousands of RPAS units weighing between 250 g to 25 kg) 

Sources: Transport Canada using U.S. FAA estimates.
The majority of RPAS are used recreationally, with the non-recreational share accounting for only 9.1% of the RPAS population in 2018 according to the FAA.
footnote 15 However, non-recreational RPAS are at an earlier stage of adoption and are therefore expected to experience a faster rate of growth than recreational users. As a result, the non-recreational share is expected to grow to 27% of the RPAS population by 2029.
Transport Canada made assumptions regarding the distribution of RPAS conducting basic and advanced operations based on its expert knowledge of the industry and consultations with stakeholders. Both basic and advanced categories are assumed to grow in tandem, although the majority of RPAS (almost three quarters of the total) are operated in basic environments (i.e. away from people and outside of controlled airspace).
Benefits
The amendments will bring public and aviation safety benefits as well as cost savings and operations consistency to businesses and government.
Public safety benefits 
The amendments will ensure RPAS pilots are competent and knowledgeable about the capabilities of their equipment as well as the scope of permissible use and the legal limitations placed on their use. Proper use of this equipment would reduce the likelihood of an RPA colliding with individuals on the ground or interfering with aircraft in flight.
There have been several incidents in Canada where RPA have collided with and injured bystanders in parks and other public areas. These incidents often go unreported so we do not know the full extent of the incidents. There has been one reported injury to Transport Canada each year during the last three years. Assuming the same ratio of reported injuries per RPAS population holds over the next decade, a conservative estimate would be that 28 such incidents would be reported in Canada during 2019 to 2029. We assume that all 28 incidents would be avoided due to safer operations. This is a conservative estimate because we are only assuming a reduction in injuries that are reported, when in reality these Regulations may prevent more injuries. The present value of the avoided injuries using this approach is estimated to be $12 million over the forecast period, or an annualized average of $1.6 million.
RPA also pose risks to aviation safety when they are flown recklessly in controlled airspace or flown in a flight path. The extent of the damage is dependent on the RPA’s kinetic energy, structure, shape, materials, and other factors. Engineering simulations have demonstrated that airborne collisions may result in high damage to aircraft.
footnote 16 There have been several RPA collisions around the world including in Canada, but none that have resulted in severe damage or fatalities as of yet. However, reports of near-misses and other RPAS interference are rising in Canada, indicating an increasing risk to aviation safety. The number of RPAS safety incidents has risen from 41 in 2014 to 136 in 2017; most of these incidents involve RPAS in controlled airspace, but there have also been serious incidents involving collisions with aircraft and individuals on the ground. In the absence of the Regulations, and applying the 2017 ratio of incidents to the RPAS population, the number of incidents would grow to more than 400 by 2029 without policy or regulatory intervention. The amendments’ benefits to aviation safety have not been monetized in the cost-benefit analysis.
Elimination of burden for non-recreational operators

The Regulations will improve the process that non-recreational RPAS pilots go through in order to legitimately fly their RPAS. The new process eliminates the need for SFOC applications for around 80% of RPAS flights, with many done on a case-by-case basis. The average time spent completing SFOC applications including communications with the government inspectors processing them is 27.3 hours, and applications are done by the company’s management.
footnote 17
These benefits are estimated by forecasting the number of SFOC that will be eliminated over the next decade based on the projected growth of non-recreational RPAS, then quantifying the time-cost savings. The present value of these savings for non-recreational pilots is estimated to be about $107.7 million over 2019–2029, or an annualized average of $14.4 million.
Fewer SFOC applications would also result in government savings of $24.9 million (present value), since inspectors will no longer be required to process the SFOC submissions for RPAS activities captured within these Regulations.
The elimination of SFOC for many operations will also provide some predictability for non-recreational RPAS operators, which has not been monetized in this analysis. There is currently a backlog of SFOC applications and a 20-day service standard, resulting in lost opportunities for operators who are not granted SFOC in time for their flights. Moving away from the case-by-case approach will provide regulatory consistency and allow non-recreational pilots to more easily make long-term plans and commitments.
Reducing the number or operations that would require SFOC is not expected to increase the risk to public or aviation safety because the knowledge base of these operators will not be affected. Non-recreational operators are currently demonstrating their knowledge through the SFOC process, but under the new requirements they will demonstrate this knowledge through testing and certification requirements. It is the mechanism that will change, not the knowledge base itself.
Costs
Compliance with the requirements will result in incremental costs to non-recreational pilots and training providers, recreational pilots, Canadian RPAS manufacturers, and to the Government of Canada, totalling $172.9 million over 2018–2029 (present value).
The pilot and the procedures 
The RPAS population forecast underpins the cost estimates for pilots over the next decade, with some additional assumptions built into the analysis (see Table 2). RPAS pilots will face incremental fee and time costs under the new Regulations. A summary of these costs can be found in Table 3.

Taken together, present value costs to non-recreational pilots and training providers are estimated to be $36.1 million over the next decade, and $134.8 million for recreational pilots.
The product 
RPAS manufacturers will incur upfront and ongoing costs to comply with the safety requirements of the amendments. Incremental costs include familiarizing themselves with the requirements, documenting the safety standard for the buyer, and self-declaring to Transport Canada using a one-page form (see Table 4). Transport Canada’s RPAS Taskforce experts recognize that Canadian manufacturers are already conducting safety tests in the absence of regulations and therefore testing costs are built into the baseline scenario. There are currently 11 Canadian RPAS manufacturers, and this number is expected to grow at the same growth rate as RPAS units in Canada, topping 25 manufacturers by 2029 in the central scenario. Manufacturers are expected to incur $336,050 in incremental costs over the next decade, or an annualized average of $44,810.

Government 
Government costs include enforcement, promotion and awareness of the Regulations, the Information Management System (IMS or “Drone Management Portal,” which will host all of the registration, testing, and certification activities and records), and the general administration of the program. Together, the present value of these government costs over the next decade totals $19.2 million, or an annualized average of $2.6 million.
Transport Canada will collect user fees for all registration, knowledge exam, and certificate issuing activities. These services are considered a private benefit to RPAS owners and pilots, therefore, program costs will be shared between Transport Canada and RPAS pilots. Transport Canada will cover 100% of promotion, enforcement, and all other government expenses. When taking these user fee revenues into account, the net cost to government is $1.7 million over the decade or an annualized average of $229,500.

A. Qualified impacts 

Benefits

Public safety: knowledgeable and competent RPAS pilots will avoid flying at high altitudes and in controlled airspace (recklessly and without authorization). This will reduce the risk of collision with other aircraft.

Non-recreational pilots: by eliminating the SFOC requirements they will have more predictability in taking on work and making long-term plans and commitments.

Sensitivity analyses
The cost-benefit analysis uses multiple scenarios and probability distributions to capture the many possibilities emerging technology may present over the next decade. Sensitivity tests were used to establish a range of outcomes, using both univariate (“tornado”) analysis and multivariate analysis of distributional functions (with simultaneous Monte Carlo simulations of 5 000 observations for all 30 distributions in the model). Combining the possibilities from both scenario and distributional analyses, the present value of net benefits ranges between −$178.3 million and +$34.5 million (over 2018–2029, discounted at 7%).footnote 30 Holding the central scenarios constant, the probability that the Regulations will lead to a net present value greater than zero is around 20%, although some expected benefits could not be monetized.
The choice of RPAS population growth scenario has the largest impact on net benefits, while the distribution of the “RPAS per recreational pilot” and “number of flights taken by recreational pilots each year” assumptions have the highest impacts on overall variation out of the 30 distributions included in the cost-benefit model.
Distributional analyses
Non-recreational pilots are expected to accrue a net benefit of $226 per pilot compared to recreational pilots who are expected to incur a net cost of $83 per pilot under the policy scenario. Although non-recreational RPAS pilots are expected to incur higher costs ($161 per pilot) than recreational RPAS pilots ($83 per pilot),footnote 31 they will also accrue a higher quantified benefit ($387 per pilot) compared to recreational pilots ($0) due to the elimination of the SFOC requirements, which only affect non-recreational pilots.
Non-recreational pilots in Quebec and Ontario are expected to accrue the highest total net benefits due to heightened non-recreational RPAS activity in those regions (regional distributions are based on 2016 and 2017 SFOC applications for RPAS operations, see Chart 2).

Manufacturers’ costs are assumed to coincide with where they are located. Currently, 6 out of 11 Canadian RPAS manufacturers are based out of Ontario, with 4 in the Prairies and one in Quebec.
“One-for-One” Rule 
The “One-for-One” Rule applies and is a net OUT due to the removal of the requirement for SFOC (OUT) and replacing that with less costly administrate burden requirements (IN). The net change in annualized administrative activities is a savings of $5,838,321 or $350 per business (expressed in $2012, calculated over 2018–2028, and discounted 7% as required by the Treasury Board’s “One-for-One” Rule guide).footnote 32
Approximately 70% of SFOC applications take one week to complete (by management), including the back-and-forth that occurs with the inspectors.footnote 33 Moreover, some companies must apply for several SFOC each year. Eliminating this requirement is expected to be a large timesaver for companies. To estimate the time savings, SFOC growth scenarios were forecasted using the growth rates of the number of non-recreational RPAS pilots over the next decade. (As explained in previous sections, these numbers are calculated using the ratio of 1.5 non-recreational pilots per non-recreational RPASfootnote 34 and applying it to the forecast for non-recreational RPAS,footnote 35 while taking into account pilot attrition.footnote 36) This is a relatively conservative growth rate because many pilots must currently apply for SFOC multiple times per year instead of just once per year as is the underlying assumption in this baseline-scenario SFOC forecast. Hence, the overall administrative burden savings estimate is itself conservative.
The largest administrative burdens that these amendments impose on non-recreational pilots (IN) are the requirements for pilots to write the knowledge exam (1 hr/new pilot) and to successfully complete a flight review for advanced operations (1 hr/new pilot). Other administrative burdens include familiarizing themselves with the new rules (5 min/new pilot), creating new GCKey and RPAS accounts (5 min/new pilot), registering all RPA (3 min/new RPA), and the flight reviewers’ knowledge exam (1 hr/new reviewer) and flight review (1 hr/new reviewer) for training providers who choose to have reviewer status. The administrative burden was forecasted using the expected growth of these components (i.e. the growth forecast for new non-recreational pilots, for new non-recreational RPAS), as described in previous sections, taking into account exam failure rates, attrition, and existing pilot-to-RPAS ratios. The number of flight reviewers was estimated by Transport Canada’s RPAS Taskforce to range from 500 to 2 000 initially based on discussions with training providers. To forecast the number of flight reviewers over the next decade, a ratio of reviewer to RPAS pilots in advanced operations was applied to the forecast for the RPAS pilots in advanced operations. Canadian average wage rates (and 25% overhead) were used for all time estimates.
Canada’s RPAS manufacturers will face new administrative burdens: familiarization with these amendments (4 hr/manufacturer at the management level) as well as a safety standard declaration which is a one-page form submitted to Transport Canada for each RPAS model (15 min/new model and 3 min/model update at the engineer-level). It is assumed that Canadian RPAS manufacturers have 2.5 RPAS models on average, that they release a new model every 2 years, and that they update all models every year.
Small business lens 
These amendments are expected to have a net reduction in costs to small businesses of $35,580,123 due to the reduction in operations that require SFOC and replacing this with less costly activities (expressed in $2012 present value, calculated over 2018–2028, and discounted 7% as required by the Treasury Board’s small business lens guide. footnote 37 Therefore, the Treasury Board’s small business lens checklist and initial and flexible option are not required in this analysis.
In consultations, small businesses expressed that the SFOC requirements are too demanding and restrict their ability to book jobs on short notice or to make long-term plans. They also emphasized that any future regulations need to permit greater flexibility and that the services provided by the government should be more responsive to the needs of the industry.
In response to these comments, Transport Canada introduced flexibility by proposing to certify pilots instead of approving projects one-by-one (as is generally the case in the SFOC process). Transport Canada will also introduce a new online service portal that will provide the industry with efficient and cost-effective services for registration, exams, and automatic certification 24/7. Documentation requirements were also minimized; reporting to the government will only occur on a reactive basis, should a safety issue emerge.
Consultation 
In 2012, the Canadian Aviation Regulation Advisory Council (CARAC) Unmanned Air Vehicle (UAV) Program Design Working Group made recommendations for amendments to existing regulations and standards, as well as introduce new regulations and standards for the safe integration of routine RPAS operations in Canadian airspace. The working group made 107 regulatory recommendations.
In 2015, the Notice of Proposed Amendment (NPA), Unmanned Air Vehicles, was published for a 92-day consultation period. It was shared with 730 stakeholders (both traditional aviation stakeholders, members of CARAC, and non-CARAC members across Canada comprised of RPAS companies and associations, as well as federal and provincial governments who had expressed an interest in RPAS). During this consultation, five regional roundtables and a national teleconference were organized across Canada to share the NPA with additional stakeholders. At the end of the consultation period, Transport Canada had received over 100 submissions.
The NPA informed the regulatory proposal published in the Canada Gazette, Part I, on July 15, 2017, for a 90-day comment period that ended on October 13, 2017. Transport Canada received 630 submissions from stakeholders. During the comment period, Transport Canada also conducted 11 engagement sessions in 9 cities, comprising over 400 attendees.
General — Post Canada Gazette, Part I, comments
Overall, commercial users appreciated the need for a regulatory framework and predictability. However, they found the proposed amendments as published in the Canada Gazette, Part I, to be too complicated and restrictive, and would still end in an ongoing need for SFOC resulting in administrative burden. Recreational operators felt that the cost of compliance in owning and operating a RPAS would negatively affect their ability to participate in the activity. Furthermore, the complexity of the rules would result in reduced compliance and negatively affect RPAS pilots of the future.
Pilot requirements — Post Canada Gazette, Part I, comments
More specifically, the major comments surrounding the pilot requirements were that stakeholders wanted to ensure that the age requirement would not interfere with teaching mechanisms and family hobbies. They were strongly supportive of knowledge exams; however, they wanted them to be easily accessible and at a low cost. Under these amendments, non-certified pilots and pilots who are under the minimum age are able to fly under the supervision of a pilot who is certified to perform the operations that will be carried out, having obtained their pilot certificate through an easily accessible, online portal.
Stakeholders were also concerned with the requirements to have liability insurance not only due to the cost involved but also because of the lack of a market availability for recreational user insurance at this time. Part IX of the CARs does not have a regulatory requirement for liability insurance. It should be noted, however, that should an incident occur, the pilot could be held accountable. Insurance will be encouraged through education and awareness material and the department will continue to monitor this issue and gather additional data.
Product requirements — Post Canada Gazette, Part I, comments
When it came to product requirements (i.e. the RPAS), Transport Canada heard that stakeholders were not supportive of their personal information being written on their machine because of privacy implications, and in the case of RPA registration requirements, the cost to do so was too expensive. There was, however, strong support for registration with de-identified numbers at a low cost to the owner. Under Part IX of the CARs, all RPA from 250 g to 25 kg must be registered with Transport Canada using the online portal.
The design standard was also of great concern for many stakeholders as they felt it not only inhibited innovation but was also not reflective of market availability. The companies that had been identified as compliant had very expensive RPAS, making entry into the industry very difficult for less expensive products. Furthermore, it was too prescriptive and not reflective of the rapidly changing technology that was available to consumers. Moreover, the weight categories were viewed by many as overly complicated, lacking in evidence to support Transport Canada’s stance, and not reflective of the most commonly flown RPAS.
Under Part IX of the CARs, the operating environments are predominantly based on the type of flying the pilot wishes to do (how close to people and in controlled airspace) rather than just the weight of the RPA. In order to conduct certain advanced operations, a manufacturer must have self-declared to Transport Canada that their RPAS have met the technical requirements set out in Standard 922 — RPAS Safety Assurance and indicate whether the RPAS can be flown in controlled airspace, near people or over people. Those flying under the basic operations rules may use the RPAS of their choice.
The proposed grandfathering clause included in the regulatory proposal published in the Canada Gazette, Part I, also raised many concerns because it did not permit current pilots to continue operating as they have been all along, in fact, it was more restrictive. Under Part IX of the CARs, RPAS that have already been deemed compliant are grandfathered for the lifespan of the model of the RPAS and can continue operations in controlled airspace and near people (less than 30 m but not closer than 5 m near people). As such, a pilot may operate a RPAS in controlled airspace and near people without a declaration having been made by the manufacturer.
Procedure requirements — Post Canada Gazette, Part I, comments
In terms of procedure requirements, stakeholders indicated that the proposal published in the Canada Gazette, Part I, was too restrictive and that many pilots would still require SFOC in order to operate their businesses due to altitude restrictions, stand off distances, speed limits, etc. Furthermore, the division of flying environments into two parts, rural and built-up areas, caused confusion. Under Part IX of the CARs, the flying environments (operations) are divided based on whether the RPAS is in controlled airspace, how close the RPAS is to people or whether the operation of the aircraft is within a certain distance from an airport or heliport. Stand off distances and speed limits are removed and the altitude restriction is harmonized under both the basic and advanced operations.
Service fees
The RPAS proposed service fees as published in the Canada Gazette, Part I, were modelled after traditional aviation fees and line items (as currently outlined in the CARs). Following prepublication, Transport Canada received significant feedback from stakeholders regarding the proposed service fees, indicating that they were too high, not reflective of the technology and not appropriate for the RPAS industry as a whole. In response to industry feedback and additional analysis, Transport Canada created a new automated platform that would provide RPAS-related services to the public from one online portal. The investment in this automated system would significantly reduce Transport Canada’s efforts in providing RPAS-related services, reducing transaction costs and rendering the original service fee proposal disproportionate.
Supplementary stakeholder consultation — Post Canada Gazette, Part I
In May 2018, Transport Canada carried out an additional targeted stakeholder discussion with over 50 stakeholders to provide the industry with its proposed changes for the amendments to the CARs. Overall, the industry was appreciative of Transport Canada’s willingness to have an additional consultation session and for the transparency, openness and communication regarding these amendments. Industry representatives acknowledged that Transport Canada was taking the industry’s views into consideration in striking the right balance between the objectives of aviation safety and innovation within the industry. Stakeholders were also provided with service fee ranges that reflect the online delivery of the services and they were received positively.
Regulatory cooperation 
Since 2015, Transport Canada and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) have collaborated regarding RPAS under the Regulatory Cooperation Council (RCC). The collaboration has focused on information sharing regarding the development and implementation of regulations for small RPAS operated within visual line-of-sight.
In June 2016, the FAA published its Final Rule, Part 107, Operation and Certification of Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems, to permit lower risk non-recreational RPAS operations. Part IX of the CARs aligns with the FAA’s general scope, intent and risk-based approach. Transport Canada operational restrictions that are more closely aligned with the FAA include those pertaining to the maximum altitude of 400 feet AGL at which a RPAS can operate, and operations at night with sufficient lighting. Furthermore, both the FAA and Transport Canada have registration requirements for RPA at a cost of $5 US/Can. The FAA has a pilot certification process with a minimum requirement of 16 years of age, similar to Transport Canada’s advanced operations. That being said, under the basic operations, Transport Canada’s minimum age requirement is 14 years old, which will help foster more growth in the industry. In terms of the minimum horizontal distance that a pilot must keep between their RPA and people that are not involved in the operation of the RPAS, the FAA does not prescribe a minimum, but Part 107 does not allow operations over people that are not part of the operation unless a waiver has been granted. Since 2016, the FAA has granted permission to a small number of operators to conduct RPAS operations over people. The FAA’s Part 107 waiver process serves a function similar to that of Transport Canada’s SFOC process. Transport Canada has allowed a path to compliance under Part IX of the CARs for pilots to operate over people where the manufacturer has made a declaration indicating, among other things, that they have verified that the model meets the requirements of Standard 922 — RPAS Safety Assurance because the risk is sufficiently mitigated with a reliable system and standardized pilot knowledge and testing.
Canada has not identified reciprocal foreign operator privileges with the United States. The FAA requires foreign commercial operators to register their RPAS in the country in which they are eligible to register and obtain operating authority from the Department of Transportation. In Canada, foreign operators are eligible to apply for a SFOC providing they are legally entitled to conduct the same operation in their own country. They need to provide evidence of such approvals when they apply for a SFOC.
All European member states are at different stages in the implementation of their RPAS rules, but are subject to the requirements and guidance of the European Union and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). While EASA has yet to finalize a regulatory framework for RPAS, the organization proposed one in May 2017 through the Notice of Proposed Amendment 2017-05. EASA’s proposed framework includes five categories based on the weight of the remotely piloted aircraft and the risks it poses to people. The European approach represents an alternative approach to the regulation of RPAS compared to Canada’s two sets of rules — basic and advanced operations.
Canada is a member of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and adopts ICAO standards into the CARs. At this time, ICAO has no standards for visual line of sight operations per se. ICAO does have guidance (see footnote 20) on the type of information that operators are requested to submit to the aviation authority in the country in which they wish to operate. Transport Canada’s current regime and the issuance of a SFOC satisfy this intent. ICAO is focused more on larger RPAS that will be certified like aircraft and for which future regulations will be introduced in Canada at a later date. Exhibit 2 compares RPAS regulations across the world.
Exhibit 2: Regulation comparison across the world 
Green represents the areas where there are provisions in place to allow the operations to occur and red represents the areas where operations are not permitted.

Rationale 
The growing use of RPAS along with the growing number of safety incidents merits that action be taken to mitigate risks to both aviation as well as people on the ground. Transport Canada’s public awareness campaigns and the Interim Order had some risk-reducing impact (as evidenced by a small decrease in the number of reported RPAS incidents in 2017). However, the risks posed by rapidly growing RPAS use are severe enough to warrant further regulatory action to ensure that RPAS pilots know how to fly safely.
Secondly, the current SFOC system under the CARs is very costly to businesses and introduces uncertainty — even for knowledgeable pilots flying in low-risk operations. The current restrictions are not proportionate to the degree and type of risk presented. Therefore, the new amendments eliminate the SFOC requirements for the vast majority of uses (i.e. RPA flown within the visual line of sight, weighing between 250 g and 25 kg) and replace them with less costly pilot certification requirements that ensure pilots are knowledgeable and fly safely. The amendments therefore bring costs back in-line with risks.
Reducing the number of operations that require SFOC
Notwithstanding the growing risk to aviation, the current regulatory approach is not conducive to supporting innovation and economic growth in the industry. In 2010, Transport Canada issued 66 SFOC for RPAS related activities, and for the next six consecutive years the volume doubled nearly each year, reaching 4 096 by 2017. Transport Canada has had challenges keeping pace and supporting the industry under the existing CARs and the SFOC demand is expected to continue to grow with the industry. The SFOC application time for businesses varies significantly from operation to operation, making it a recurrent task, and Transport Canada’s 20 working-day service standard is not conducive to industry demand. Commercial pilots are losing contracts, spending time filling out applications rather than working and making an income. Often contract requests are received under short notice, and if industry does not want to lose business, it is resulting in an environment of non-compliance. Furthermore, the SFOC process does not take into account the technology that is changing almost daily, resulting in new use cases; in order for businesses to take advantage of such uses, they often need to submit another SFOC application. Therefore, the growing industry warrants a stable regulatory environment that accommodates most use cases and allows for an easy path to compliance.
Reduce risks to public safety
Considerable safety risks stem from RPA being flown recklessly and/or in areas where they are not allowed to be flown. There are numerous incidents reported every month in Canada where RPAS are flown at high altitudes, in flight paths, or close to people on the ground. Many RPAS pilots are not aware of the current rules or the safety risks that flying RPAS in these manners pose. Moreover, these risks are expected to increase in-step with the growing popularity of RPAS. The creation of standardized knowledge and testing, and regular recency requirements ensure pilots’ knowledge is kept up-to-date. These requirements introduce new costs to recreational pilots, but they are necessary to ensure a solid safety knowledge base among pilots to reduce public safety risks.
In order for more effective tracking and enforcement that could further enable efficient air traffic management services in the future, registration of all RPAS with aircraft weighing between 250 g and 25 kg is mandatory. Registration is designed to be a low-cost solution to identify RPA flown in an unsafe or non-compliant manner.
Additionally, the system reliability of the RPAS itself varies significantly from model to model, further increasing risks to aviation and people. Operations that pose the highest risks when it comes to the system reliability of the RPAS are those near or over people and in controlled airspace. The reliability of the RPAS can be affected by a number of things. For instance, depending on the materials used in the construction of the RPAS, it can affect how hard and how much damage it causes upon impact if it were to hit a person or a windshield. footnote 38 Unfortunately at this time, there is no consensus in the industry regarding a RPAS design standard and the consequences of Transport Canada not intervening could result in severe injuries. As a result, Transport Canada is introducing Standard 922 — RPAS Safety Assurance, and providing manufacturers with safety targets they must meet in order to provide more consistent reliability of RPAS operated in the higher-risk areas — controlled airspace and operations near and over people.
Service fees
Transport Canada undertook a comprehensive exercise to develop an informed costing of the RPAS program and establish appropriate RPAS service fees. The costing approach adhered to the Treasury Board Secretariat’s (TBS) Guidelines on Costing and sought to establish defensible and transparent cost estimates. Costing for cost recovery purposes requires that the “full cost” of providing an activity be calculated. For cost-recoverable service fees, full cost is the allowable upper limit of the fee and represents the departure point for pricing. A full cost estimate comprises all relevant resource costs incurred to deliver an activity or provide a service, including direct and indirect costs. The RPAS costing exercise factored in salary costs, benefit plans, training and travel, office accommodations, internal support services, and information technology system development and maintenance costs. These costs were allocated to RPAS activities and services based on resource consumption and level of effort.
The results of the costing exercise estimated that the full cost of running the RPAS program is $8.4 million annually. The cost-recoverable component of the program (i.e. provision of the RPA registration, knowledge exam, pilot certificate and flight reviewer rating services) is estimated at $3.1 million annually.
Public-private benefit assessment 
The determination of an appropriate cost recovery rate takes a number of factors into account; one important component is the Public Private Benefit (PPB) tool. The PPB tool was developed by TBS to estimate the degree to which a service provides a private benefit, if any, beyond benefits enjoyed by the general public. For the RPAS program, three separate PPBs were completed. The analysis conducted through the PPBs determined that the benefits provided to flight reviewers through the flight reviewer exam and flight reviewer rating are private (100% private), while RPA registration, and the knowledge exam and pilot certification share a mix of private and public benefits (60% private, 40% public). This became the starting point for determining an appropriate cost recovery rate.
International fee comparisons 
Transport Canada then conducted research on the service fees applied by other countries to RPAS operators. Several countries require RPA registration (at a relatively consistent fee of $5 or €5). However, there are minimal regulatory schemes that parallel these proposed Regulations overall; and, many other countries are in the process of developing regulations and their own service fees, so comparable benchmarks were difficult to locate.
Other fee policy considerations
Transport Canada then broadened its analysis to consider compliance and the structure of the regulatory framework. Given that the purchase cost of many RPAS is low, and that there are currently no fees associated with flying an RPAS, it is important that the price of registration, online exams and pilot certification not be prohibitive and dissuade RPAS operators from compliance. Moreover, pilots conducting advanced operations are required to pay an additional flight review fee to a third party. Therefore, the fees for these services were kept relatively modest. Similarly, the Regulations depend on flight reviewers participating in the regulatory process by conducting flight reviews for RPAS pilots. Therefore, though these respective services are deemed to be of a largely private benefit, the Regulations (and therefore, the safety of Canadians) depend on these actors’ involvement, so the cost recovery rate is lower than what might have been otherwise anticipated.
Overall rationale for amendments
The amendments’ overall focus on enhancing the knowledge and accountability of RPAS pilots can achieve substantial safety benefits. The amendments’ service fees and the online Drone Management Portal were designed to keep costs low while ensuring ease of use.
RPA registration and pilot certification add costs for recreational pilots but are necessary for accountability and to mitigate the safety risks to aviation and people on the ground. Additionally, the costly SFOC system is replaced with a pilot certification system that has the same safety objectives, but with a lower cost and with reduced business uncertainty.
Implementation 
To support the implementation of Part IX of the CARs, Transport Canada created a digital service delivery solution by developing an online Drone Management Portal that provides one-stop shopping for RPAS pilots and owners. Both pilots and owners can create a personal account using their Government of Canada key, register their RPA, complete their knowledge exams, and receive their electronic pilot certificates all through the portal. Through the portal, pilots are tested on their knowledge of procedures on how to manage risks and safety more effectively, coordinate with an air navigation service providers, weather conditions, etc.
Manufacturers self-declare to Transport Canada if their RPAS can be flown in controlled airspace, operate near people (between 30 m and no less than 5 m) or over people (less than 5 m), using safety targets provided by Transport Canada. The onus is on the manufacturer to ensure through testing that their RPAS meets Transport Canada safety targets before declaring it has met the requirements. Some examples of performance targets are: the RPA does not transfer energy sufficient to cause a severe injury or fatality or the RPAS has risk mitigating measures like a parachute to protect people from being hit by the RPA if it lost contact with the control station.
Some amendments will come into force on the day on which the amending Regulations are published in the Canada Gazette, Part II, such as registration and the ability to take exams; however, the remainder of the amendments, including operational provisions, will come into force on June 1, 2019. The Drone Management Portal will be available on the day on which the amending Regulations are published in the Canada Gazette, Part II.
Service standards
In the vast majority of cases, RPAS-related transactions between clients and Transport Canada occur in real time through a secure, automated system, 24 hours a day, and 7 days a week. However, in rare instances, the system could encounter difficulty where additional intervention outside of the automated system may be required; thus a maximum service standard of 10 days will apply to all RPAS services. These service standards will be reconsidered two years after these amendments come into force.
The Service Fees Act permits the Minister of Transport the discretion to remit a portion of fees that have been collected if the applicable service standard is not met. Remission will take place according to Transport Canada’s remission policy.
Safety awareness
Transport Canada’s RPAS safety awareness strategy seeks to maintain and improve the safety of Canadian airspace by supporting a well-informed RPAS industry while encouraging innovation and interest in aviation. Transport Canada will expand its outreach by building on existing collaborations and establishing new avenues to establish mechanisms through which the RPAS industry can get consistent, timely and accurate safety information. Transport Canada also wishes to impart to Canadians that RPAS are legitimate airspace users with benefits to society, as long as safety risks are mitigated by following the rules. The Canada.ca Drone Safety web page will continue to be the primary source for information on the regulatory requirements and how to comply, and will be supplemented by efforts to increase Transport Canada’s presence both virtually and in person. These efforts will include a new “look and feel” for all RPAS safety-related material and an updated interactive “Where to Fly” web page with the National Research Council.
The primary touch points that Transport Canada will target for safety education messages relate to the purchase and use of a RPAS: interaction with technology websites, retailers, and manufacturers; interaction with national or local associations or flying clubs; and interaction at industry events. Transport Canada will also continue to improve our understanding of the average RPAS pilot to inform further outreach efforts.
Enforcement and partnerships
The safe operation of RPAS in Canada is a shared responsibility between Transport Canada who develops and enforces the rules, the RPAS operators who have an obligation to operate their RPAS safely, and law enforcement who are responsible for maintaining public safety.
Under the Act, the Minister of Transport has the authority to issue administrative monetary penalties (AMPs) to anyone who violates designated provisions of the Act and the CARs. In June 2017, Transport Canada partnered with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) pursuant to subsection 4.3(1) of the Act to issue AMPs for designated offences to complement enforcement actions by the Transport Canada Enforcement Inspectorate. Most of the provisions in Part IX of the CARs are enforced through the assessment of AMPs imposed in accordance with sections 7.6 to 8.2 of the Act, which carry a maximum fine of $5,000 for individuals and $25,000 for corporations, and include the potential suspension or cancellation of a person’s Canadian Aviation Document. More serious contraventions may be pursued as indictable offences or be punishable on summary conviction, where permitted. That being said, Transport Canada Enforcement Inspectors continue to offer oral counselling before issuing an AMP and subscribe to a graduated system whereby lower levels are established for first time and second-time offenders if applicable. In addition, Transport Canada is pursuing similar partnerships such as that between Transport Canada and the RCMP with other law enforcement agencies across the country to address the growing need for increased enforcement capacity.
Transport Canada is also considering taking part in other activities to address these needs including developing a toolkit designed specifically to assist law enforcement officers on the front lines and carrying out an enforcement campaign targeted to areas where reports of remotely piloted aircraft incidents are at their highest frequency. This campaign would seek to educate users on the safe operation of their RPAS and their legal responsibilities, while also taking enforcement action if necessary.
Gender-based analysis plus (GBA+) 
GBA+ was completed and found that these amendments are gender-neutral and apply equally to all Canadians. Overall, these amendments will help to ensure the safety of all Canadians on the ground and in the air. However, these amendments have the most significant impact on men, given that the vast majority of RPAS operators (recreational and commercial) are currently male. These amendments require operators to comply with numerous steps to lawfully operate a RPAS. While these steps require effort, the result is the enjoyment of a safe recreational activity, and potentially economic benefits from a growing commercial industry.
Transport Canada is taking steps to be more gender inclusive in its work on the RPAS regulations and future RPAS policy. The RPAS industry is reflective of the gender disparity inherent in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields, with an overwhelming proportion of RPAS engineers, manufacturers, educators and operators being male. Sex-disaggregated data in the RPAS industry is extremely limited; however, there is much literature written about the lack of female participation in STEM, which parallels that of aviation including RPAS. Literature addressing gender dynamics in STEM has noted that gendered language reinforces stereotypes of who belongs in which “space” (or not). The National Aviation Space Agency (NASA) moved to use gender-inclusive language in 2006 to signal that space was an environment for men and women, employing the terms “crewed” and “uncrewed” instead of “manned” and “unmanned.” In this regulatory package, the term “Remotely Piloted Aircraft System” has replaced “Unmanned Aircraft System,” to reflect the same sentiment: though the RPAS industry may be male-dominated at the moment, there is space and room for girls, women, etc., to work and play. By employing the use of such gender-neutral terminology, Transport Canada is signalling gender inclusiveness to RPAS operators and the larger industry.
The implementation of these amendments will take further steps to address inclusiveness. For example, Transport Canada is developing a safety education campaign that is deliberately inclusive and will speak to Canadians of different genders (as well as ages, ethnicities, etc.). While focus in the first year of the campaign will be on making sure messages are deliberately inclusive, in the second year of the campaign ideas to specifically target women and girls will be considered.
Furthermore, there is a lack of sex-disaggregated data pertaining to RPAS, particularly on a large scale. Further study of gender and RPAS is planned, including the contracting of additional reports and the presentation of a gender-based paper on the RPAS industry at the International Civil Aviation Organization. As additional information becomes available through Transport Canada’s information technology system, analytics can be targeted through a GBA+ lens. This will lead to better targeting of education and safety promotion.
Lastly, Transport Canada will leverage the work done by other federal organizations around women in STEM. For example, Transport Canada will look for opportunities to collaborate with Innovation, Science and Economic Development (ISED) Canada’s women in STEM campaign for opportunities to advance the RPAS-specific cause. Transport Canada will also make efforts to keep abreast of other work being done by its federal counterparts and explore opportunities for partnership wherever possible.
Performance measurement and evaluation 
Establishing a framework for measuring and evaluating the performance of these amendments is necessary to ensure the amendments are achieving their stated objectives: regulatory predictability and safety risk mitigation. Regularly scheduled data collection and program evaluation activities are important as evaluation tools.
The Matrix below groups the intended outcomes, indicators, and data sources for measuring indicators according to the objectives they are trying to achieve (see Table 6).

Transport Canada has developed a number of tools to help achieve the stated objectives of these amendments. These tools also serve as valuable feedback mechanisms for performance measurement. They include

the Canada.ca Drone Safety web pages: web pages that explain the regulations in plain language and serves as a hub for RPAS safety resources;
the Drone Incident Report Form: a web-based form that Canadians can use to report drone incidents to Transport Canada;
the Drone Management Portal: a task-oriented web portal where operators can register their RPA and take exams; and
municipal, provincial/territorial, first responders, and RPAS industry working groups to facilitate communication between Transport Canada and stakeholders.

Transport Canada intends to conduct environmental scans of the Canadian RPAS industry and to administer surveys to Canadian RPAS operators on a recurring basis to help collect performance measurement data. These environmental scans and surveys will also inform policy decision-making by identifying new trends and issues in the RPAS industry.
Transport Canada civil aviation inspectors have already been sensitized to the interrelated objectives that Transport Canada intends to achieve with these amendments. Transport Canada is confident that those entitled to enforce these amendments will carry out their responsibilities in a manner which maximizes the intended outcomes.
