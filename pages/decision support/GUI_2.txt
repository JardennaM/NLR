A Decision Making Model For UAV Implementation

November 13, 2016 



 




Decision Making Process developed by droneii.com  – click to download full-size model

To make the right decisions it is important to define the results you need.
Therefore you can use the inverse decision-making process [modeled above]. After the initial question if you want to hire a professional drone operator or starting a drone operation yourself it necessary to have a close look at the local regulations and environmental conditions. Once the mission and all aspects of operation are clear, you can start to configure the unmanned aerial system (UAS).
With all information describing your plans (incl. fixed and operational costs) you can now chose again whether to start your own drone operation or to buy in the service. Looking at the entire value chain it becomes clear that many resource and time-intensive activities can be replaced. Looking at repetitive activities (e.g. checking construction progress of the same location), the savings through UAV operation can be even greater.
The report Value Chain Analysis for UAV-based Surveying represents the essence of what you need to know if you consider using drone technology in surveying. It offers a detailed outline of technological, legal and operational aspects of UAV application in comparison to conventional surveying methods. The question when UAV technology in the construction industry pays off economically is discussed
in detail.
A few weeks ago I introduced the db.c UAV Industry Standards Stack. This is a great illustration of the decision-making processes that every organization will go through as they ponder the pros and cons of implementation. And it is what we will be exploring with the 2017 Commercial UAV Implementation Survey.
Every company has their own version of this process (in the conceptual not the literal sense.) Smart account teams will be able to identify key variables and provide supporting data that a prospect can use to develop their internal business case.
