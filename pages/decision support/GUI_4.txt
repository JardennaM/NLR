                book series (CCIS, volume 949)AbstractIn case of a dangerous incident, such as a fire, a collision or an earthquake, a lot of contextual data is available for the first incident responders when handling this incident. Based on this data, a commander on scene or dispatchers need to make split-second decisions to get a good overview on the situation and to avoid further injuries or risks. Therefore, we propose a decision support system that can aid incident responders on scene in prioritizing the rescue efforts that need to be addressed. The system collects relevant data from a custom designed drone by detecting objects such as firefighters, fires, victims, fuel tanks, etc. The drone autonomously observes the incident area, and based on the detected information it proposes a prioritized based action list on e.g. urgency or danger to incident responders.This paper presents the architecture of the framework and a prototype implementation and evaluation of a decision support system, responsible for digesting and prioritizing the large amount of contextual data captured at an incident site. The evaluation of the decision support system shows that the proposed solution works accurately in supporting incident responders in providing a sorted overview of the actions needed in real-time, with an average response time of 334 ms on a less powerful device and 263 ms on a powerful device equipped with a GPU.KeywordsDisaster management Recommendation systems Decision analysis and decision support systems This is a preview of subscription content, log in to check access.NotesAcknowledgementThe authors would like to thank all partners namely, Xtendit Solutions, Fire.BE, DroneMatrix, CityMesh, Seris Security, SAIT and KU Leuven - Eavise, in the 3DSafeGuard-VL project and the Agency for Innovation by Science and Technology (Vlaio) for funding and support.References1.FLIR Boson. http://www.flir.it/cores/boson/2.Sony Semiconductor Solutions Corporation - IMX274QC. https://www.sony-semicon.co.jp/products_en/new_pro/october_2016/imx274lqc_e.html3.Abadi, M., et al.: TensorFlow: a system for large-scale machine learning.
