Droneshield DroneCannon RW
for Remote Weapon Stations







What is the DroneCannon RW
DroneCannon RW from DroneShield offers a lightweight, soft kill, drone jamming solution for use on remote weapon stations. The DroneCannon RW module will force drones (single or swarm attack) into a fail-safe mode where they will either hover or slowly descend. This function will allow the operator to utilise a kinetic weapon or other mounted equipment to more easily neutralize the target. Included DroneShield jamming technology has been developed specifically for drone mitigation, offering a effective response to an urgent threat.
DroneCannon RW has been engineered specifically for mobile operations, incorporating a lightweight chassis and optimised electronics with shock and vibration isolators to endure the most demanding terrain. The DroneCannon RW module has been designed for use on any remote weapons station.




Benefits Of DroneCannon RW
