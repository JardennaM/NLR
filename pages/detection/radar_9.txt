Testing radar designs for clear and reliable detection of small UAVs

With the recent advances in technology and increased public interest, the number of commercial unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) – or drones – and their applications are rising dramatically. While providing numerous advantages in applications such as aerial surveillance, high-resolution imaging/mapping and facility inspection, there is a growing need to ensure safe and secure operation and to counter unauthorized, criminal or even terroristic activities. Test and measurement solutions from Rohde & Schwarz provide the means to validate radar system designs to enable clear and reliable detection of small UAVs in the lower air space.
