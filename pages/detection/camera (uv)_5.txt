            Description



                            UV Camera for UAV
DayCor® ROMpact is a bi spectral UV-Visible block camera module with excellent scanning & corona detection capabilities that fit scanning high and medium voltage electrical installations. Due to its small size and low weight ROMpact can be installed in payloads of various sizes and shapes and in particular on UAS. ROMpact can also be mounted on fixed mounts and on a moving pan & tilt. ROMpact’s precision is attributed to the embedded DayCor® Technology, which guarantees high sensitivity to UV corona discharge. ROMpact performs in daytime, records and transfers in real time pinpointed information of occurrences of corona PD and of electrical faults. ROMpact is attractive to systems with size and weight limitation and to systems that wish to incorporate multi spectral sensors. 
FEATURES
>>High sensitivity to UV signals of corona & arcing
