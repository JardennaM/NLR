Infrared for aerial & UAV has made hard-to-see, hard-to-reach or large canvas areas (such as large commercial buildings, wind farms, solar farms, etc.) but a bird’s eye view away. We offer effective, high quality thermal imaging cameras that are mountable to any drone, UAS, UAV, or multicopter platform as well as helicopters and small planes.These cameras include our 9320 P-Series, 9640 P-Series, SWIR 128 P-Series, SWIR 640 P-Series, SWIR 320 P-Series, and our 7320 P-Series. They are lightweight, portable, and run on less than 1 watt of power, via USB connection. Paired with our IR Flash software your receive real time radiometric data stream directly to any hard drive or portable device.We also offer electronic drone packages that include thermal camera in your choice of spectrum and our ICI IR Flash Software, with either the DJI Phantom 2 or DJI S900 Hexcopter. Each come with battery and charger for a relatively quick and easy charge. Many optional accessories are also available such as additional infrared cameras and/or visible cameras as well as a ground station that will allow autonomous flight, propulsion upgrades that increase flight endurance, and an Ipad Mini for live first person field-of-view.These drones are relatively easy to fly (think toy helicopter) and are a joy to learn. They have a 1 to 1.5 mile range, and are self-stabilized allowing them to maintain their position in space accurate to 1m2 space.Each drone can handle up to 3 thermal imaging cameras thanks to our UAV Sensor Control Module. It provides remote management of our infrared cameras with highly detailed mosaics, offering exact temperature data for analysis.And now, our newest addition to the ICI product line, the much anticipated ICI complete drone system: The Halo | Thermal Infrared Aerial UAV System is available.  A durable, lightweight, carbon fiber aerial uav system / drone capable of hi-def visible imaging, thermal long wave, short wave, RGB, & optical gas imaging.
