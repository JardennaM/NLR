AeroSentry® & Drone Detection as a Service (DSaaS)
We offer the ability to detect, track and identify drones across a wide area, on land or at sea.  Using multi-sensory technologies we can give you notice of a drone operating in your airspace.  We design, install, support and update our Drone Defence systems with security-cleared experts.  Our backwards-compatible systems can be fully integrated into existing Security Management Systems (SMS) which reduces the training requirement for your staff.
With numerous deployments around the world, we are experts in our field.











 




How do we do it?
Radio Frequency (RF) scanners provide the most cost-effective solution for detecting, tracking and identifying drones over a wide area.  They have the ability to scan the electromagnetic spectrum and identify the specific transmissions from commercial drones.  As long as the drone is transmitting a signal (like live video or telemetry) then our RF scanner will detect it.
If the drone’s operator is also within our sensor network we have the ability to identify and track them so security services and law enforcement officials can respond.





















 


Radio Frequency Scanning Technology
We use the latest RF detection hardware overplayed with proprietary advanced analytic software to detect and differentiate drone radio signals.  Where the drone is operator controlled or is transmitting a live video feed we have the ability to detect, track and identify the drone.  In addition we have the ability to synchronise time-stamps across a number of sensors we can use this information to geo-locate a drone, its operator and track them in real-time.
Our RF scanner can also identify the drone based on the type of command protocols it is transmitting, we check this signal against our DronePrint database to determine the drone type.
With this information, we can determine the type of drone and its capabilities.  Post-incident analysis can also be conducted to determine drone types and patterns of use in an area.

AeroSentry® DND360
AeroSentry® DRB1000
Drone Detection as a Service (DSaaS)








Proximity Drone Detection
AeroSentry® DND360 provides a drone/no drone proximity drone detection capability.  Depending on the the operational environment the system can detect the presence of a drone’s RF signature up to 5km away.  This information can then be used to alert security operatives or automatically activate a drone jamming system.

Direction Range and Bearing
AeroSentry® DRB1000 uses advanced RF signal processing techniques to determine the bearing of the drone and approximate range.  from a single location the AeroSentry™ sensor can deliver a general direction of the incoming drone so security officers know where the potential threat is coming from.  This allows for a more comprehensive operational response.

Drone Detection Subscription
Our DSaaS solution provides drone detection, identification and tracking capabilities to a range of customers.  We deploy and maintain a network of sensors across an area and our customers gain access to a secure, bespoke and intuitive online account where they can monitor drone activity near them.

Drone Detection System Costs
Relative Costs for a Drone Detection system depends on the technology used and requirements.  In most cases, a robust RF detection system is the most efficient option.  Where specific needs dictate then other technologies may be needed.  It is important to note that there is no ‘silver bullet’ when it comes to drone detection, like with any security product a determined assailant may find a way to defeat a security system.
Our role is to minimise the risk to you and provide you with timely intelligence allowing you the opportunity to respond.
