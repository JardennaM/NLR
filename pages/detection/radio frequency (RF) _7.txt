Drone Neutralization   ►




Detection:
Taking into account growing popularity, advanced features and inconspicuous design of modern drones, detection becomes the first step in guarding against them.
Our company offers a wide portfolio of different solutions for drone detection based on different technologies: radar detection, audio detection, radio frequency detection, video detection, thermal detection.
The product line of drone detection equipment includes radars systems, acoustic sensors, RF detectors, video and thermal cameras with different technical features and performance capabilities.
These drone detection solutions can be used separately or can be combined in order to provide full protection and meet even the most demanding requirements of our customers.







Perimeter Surveillance Radars
SpotterRF Perimeter Surveillance Radars are used for perimeter protection of strategic sites, security installations, vital infrastructure. Perimeter surveillance radar systems detect unauthorized vehicles, people or drones approaching the protected zone perimeter.

Acoustic Sensors
DroneShield acoustic sensors use an advanced UAV detection technology with an extensive database of UAV acoustic signatures, which allows to sense drones invisible to radars or with lack of radio-frequency links.

Infrared and Video Surveillance Systems
Infrared and Surveillance systems could be used in various spheres, like border control, perimeter security, land/sea observation and monitoring. Providing high zoom camera view, 360 degree rotation platforms, those systems is a must have for every object or perimeter security.

RF Detectors
The GROK Radio Frequency scanner is used to scan radio frequencies nearby, to locate the drone and the drone (UAV) operator. Each drone and transmitter has own channels and frequency bands. GROK RF is programmed to scan, analyze and detect the Radio frequency bands from the drone (UAV) or drone operator.
