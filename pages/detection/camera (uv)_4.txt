      Corona Airborne Systems   
Berg offers Ofil's airborne UV corona cameras tasked with detecting electrical discharges with UV technology. Ofils airborne systems are perfect solutions for performing corona inspections when large areas require inspection or for areas are difficult to reach. They can be attached to drones or helicopters and detect not only corona but also oil spills or fires. Need assistance with selecting the right UV corona camera for your inspections? Contact us by calling 847-577-3980 or email info@bergeng.com. A knowledgeable Berg sales engineer will be happy to assist.
