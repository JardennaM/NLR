MAIA M2









 

 
MAIA M2 – Multispectral Modular Camera
MAIA M2 is the new lightest and smallest modular multispectral camera fully customizable by the user, according to his needs of multispectral survey applications.

 
MAIA M2 can be equipped with a large portfolio of VIS-NIR bandpass filters.
The camera module is based on a double global shutter CMOS sensor with 8/12 bits resolution, automatic exposure with selectable target value. Lenses are factory geometrically calibrated.
Each module has stand-alone capability with external trigger and strobe or free run mode. Several inputs/outputs for external devices interfacing are available, such as trigger, strobe, serial port, USB and two aux port.
Module has very small size and low weight, the lowest values in the market.
Multi-module management, up to 8 different modules based on different couples of sensors and filters, is available by using the external controller.
Multispectral raw images and parameters are stored in a removable SD card, and can be also downloaded via USB and they are ready then for MultiCam Stitcher Pro, the MAIA images pre-processing software.
 
Frame

MAIA M2       2 400 €  VAT excl.
 
MAIA M2 Custom Bandpass Filters
MAIA M2 can be equipped with a large portfolio of VIS-NIR bandpass filters. The following selected filters are available in stock; for other specific bands, we are available to respond to your requests after consulting with our supplier

 
MAIA M2 Pre-selected Bandpass Filters Pair
The MAIA M2 single module can be composed using a pair of available band-pass filters. The choice of the pre-selected filter pairs will be made according to the most widely used multispectral indexes with two single bands, or on the basis of the aim of the multispectral survey.

 
 MAIA M2 combination of modules
The following table shows some combinations of 2 or more MAIA M2 modules, useful to allow the calculation of many of the main multispectral indexes.

 
STD CTU – Standard Control Unit
STD CTU is equipped with a GNSS L1 module.

 
The Control Unit manages:

synchronization and geo-referencing of the images
powering of MAIA M2 modules
reading of PWM inputs for shutter, start, stop and reset
Light Sensor input for fine tuning radiometric correction
two outputs with customizable variable advance for delay compensation of any connected DSLR cameras
up to 8 modules for a total of 16 bands
wide supply range 8-26 Volts

STD CTU       1 440 €  VAT excl.
 
RTK CTU – Real Time Kinematic Control Unit
RTK CTU is equipped with a GNSS L1 RTK module and a UHF LoRa Radio Modem.

The Control Unit manages:

synchronization and geo-referencing of the images
powering of MAIA M2 modules
reading of PWM inputs for shutter, start, stop and reset
Light Sensor input for fine tuning radiometric correction
two outputs with customizable variable advance for delay compensation of any connected DSLR cameras
up to 8 modules for a total of 16 bands
wide supply range 8-26 Volts

RTK CTU       1 920 €  VAT excl.
 
MAIA M2 Multispectral Modular System Configuration Example
The following one is a connection diagram for the RTK control unit with 3 MAIA M2 and 2 external DSLR cameras.

The RTK Control Unit is supplied including the GNSS antenna, the UHF antenna, the Light Sensor and the connection cables for batteries, PWM inputs and DSLR shutter input.
The MAIA M2 modules are supplied including all cables for the stand-alone operating mode and the connection cable to the Control Unit.
 
MAIA M2 will be available on the market from September 2018.
