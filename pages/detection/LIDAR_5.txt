Unmanned Aerial Vehicle for Laser Scanning  (LiDAR UAV)




Over the past decade the use of drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) as a flexible sensor platform for agro-environmental mapping and monitoring has evolved rapidly. Initially from a research perspective but increasingly commercial UAV applications are starting to be developed for operational use. Recently, Laser Scanner systems known as the Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) technique have also become available for UAVs. The Shared Research Facilities  of Wageningen University and Research has acquired the Riegl RiCopter Unmanned Laser Scanning System.



From this LiDAR system, detailed and precise 3D models of objects can be collected and mapped: e.g., plants, trees, buildings, infrastructure such as dikes, and the ground surface. Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) works by sending laser pulses into an array of accurately defined directions in fast succession. Measuring the travel time it takes for each laser-pulse to be reflected from the targets and returned to the LiDAR-scanner allows reconstruction of distances and directions of surfaces surrounding the scanner. Attaching a LiDAR scanner to a moving platform like a UAV allows 3D mapping of larger surface areas as the UAV platform is moving ahead.The acquired Unmanned Laser Scanning datasets can either be provided as raw datasets or as processed end-product (3D point cloud x,y,z data, and gridded surface models). The delivery format and processing level will be agreed on with the user of the instrument. For all flight operations of the Laser Scanning UAV can a certified pilot and a trained operator are required.

Applications
The UAV Laser Scanning system allows the creation of diverse datasets, ranging from basics like point cloud data (LAS format) and high-resolution RGB imagery, to more advanced products like Crop Height Models (CHM), point density distribution maps and forestry parameters.  Applications include mapping the structure of crops (phenotyping and precision agriculture), trees (orchards and forestry), and infrastructure (construction and safety but also can be extended to terrain mapping for applications like archaeology and coastal management. In addition, other applications can be brought in and discussed.


Complementary techniques
We also offer access to other UAV mounted camera systems (multi-spectral, hyperspectral) as part of the Unmanned Aerial Remote Sensing Facility and access to a Terrestrial Laser Scanning system as part of the Laser Scanning Facility of Wageningen University and Research.
