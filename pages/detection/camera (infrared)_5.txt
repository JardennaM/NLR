Posted February 17, 2019 by Fintan Corrigan
A thermal imaging camera on a drone turns it into a powerful tool, which can be used in many sectors from construction, mining, electrical, surveillance, firefighting, search and rescue.Thermal drones which use vision imaging cameras have so many positive uses by detecting heat coming from almost all objects and materials turning them into images and video.Below, you will find information on how thermal imaging works, how to interpret thermal images, heat maps and color scales.You will find the best heat vision cameras for drones, thermal imaging kits, gimbals, camera mounts and thermal drones on the market.You will also read about similar but different technologies such as illuminated infrared cameras and night vision cameras. At the end we take a brief look at the various sectors, which use thermal imaging cameras on drones.

 Along with thermal cameras, drones can carry many other types of sensors and cameras covering many sectors.  We are hearing about new uses for drones every week.  Drones certainly are making a big impact in our everyday lives without us even knowing it.  You can read about these in our best uses for drones article.About Thermal Imaging Camera TechnologyHow Does Thermal Imaging Work AnsweredHeat vision cameras or thermal imaging cameras are in fact really heat detecting sensors. These thermal cameras are also known by various names including;Thermal CameraHeat Vision CameraThermal Vision CameraThermal Imaging SensorThermal Imaging CameraTemperature Sensor CameraThermal Heat Vision SensorHeat Signature CameraHeat Sensor CameraThermal vision cameras make pictures or video from heat, not visible light. Heat (infrared thermal radiation) and light are both parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. However, a camera, which can detect visible light will not see thermal radiation and vice versa.Thermal cameras detect more than just heat. Heat vision cameras detect the tiny differences in heat, even as small as 0.01° Celsius. This information is then displayed as various colors on a display, in thermal software or apps.Thermal Radiation And Heat SignaturesEverything in our lives give off thermal energy, even ice. The hotter something is, the more thermal energy it emits. This emitted thermal energy is called a “heat signature.”The hotter the object, the more it radiates. The Sun obviously radiates off more energy than a hot cup of tea. The temperature also affects the wavelength and frequency of the radiated waves.Objects at typical room temperatures radiate energy as infrared waves. When you see thermal photographs or videos of the radiation surrounding a person, animal or a hot mug of coffee, the energy radiated from the object is usually a range of wavelengths. This is usually referred to as an emission spectrum.As the temperature of an object increases, the wavelengths within the spectra of the emitted radiation also decrease. Hotter objects emit shorter wavelength, higher frequency radiation.For example, the coils of an electric toaster are considerably hotter than room temperature and emit electromagnetic radiation in the visible spectrum.  The coils on the toaster glow red and we can feel the heat by putting our hands near the coils providing us with a convenient warning that the coils are hot.

 Thermal radiation can occur through matter or through a region of space that is void of matter (a vacuum). The heat received on Earth from the Sun is the result of electromagnetic waves traveling through the void or vacuum of space between the Earth and the Sun.Quick Scientific Explanation Of Thermal RadiationThermal radiation or heat, is the discharge of electromagnetic waves from all matter, which has a temperature greater than absolute zero (−273.15° Celsius). It converts thermal energy into electromagnetic energy.All objects radiate energy in the form of electromagnetic waves. The rate at which this energy is released is proportional to the Kelvin temperature (T) raised to the fourth power.Thermal energy consists of the kinetic energy (all moving things) of random movements of atoms and molecules in matter.These atoms and molecules are composed of charged particles (protons and electrons) and kinetic interactions among matter particles which result in charge-acceleration and dipole-oscillation.This results in the electrodynamic generation of coupled electric and magnetic fields, resulting in the emission of photons, radiating energy (thermal radiation) away from the body through its surface boundary.Thermal Sensitivity NETD (mK)When you look at the specifications of a Thermal Camera, you will often see the technical details for  “NETD”. This NETD expression stands for Noise Equivalent Temperature Difference.It is a measure for how well a thermal imaging detector is able to distinguish between very small differences in thermal radiation in the image. NETD is typically expressed in milli-Kelvin or mK.It is also sometimes referred to as “Thermal Contrast”. Basically it is when the noise is equivalent to the smallest measurable temperature difference, the detector has reached its limit of its ability to resolve a useful thermal signal. The more noise there is, the higher the NETD value of the detector.

 How NETD Is MeasuredIn order to measure the noise equivalent temperature difference of a detector, the camera must be pointed at a temperature controlled black body. The black body needs to stabilize before starting the measurement. The noise equivalent temperature difference is then measured at a specific temperature. It is not a single snapshot measurement, but rather a temporal measurement of noise.You can read further on NETD in this article entitled “What Is NETD In A Thermal Camera“.Infrared ThermographyIR thermography is the method of transforming an infrared image into a radiometric one which allows temperature values to be read from the image.How To Interpret Thermal ImagesMost thermal cameras produce a video output in which white areas indicate maximum radiated energy and black areas indicate lower radiation. The gray scale image contains the maximum amount of information.However, in order to ease general interpretation of thermal images and facilitate subsequent presentation, the thermal image can be artificially colorized.This is achieved by allocating desired colors to blocks of grey levels to produce the familiar colorized images. This enables easier image interpretation.Additionally, by choosing the correct colorization palette, the image may be enhanced to show particular energy levels in greater detail. What Is Emissivity In Thermal Imaging?To read correct temperatures, another important factor needs to be taken into account. That is a factor known as emissivity.Emissivity is the efficiency, which an object emits infrared radiation and is highly dependent on properties of the material or object. It is a measure of the efficiency of a surface to emit thermal energy relative to a perfect black body source. It directly scales the intensity of the thermal emission and all real values are less than 1.0.The emissivity may be highly dependent on the surface morphology, roughness, oxidation, spectral wavelength, temperature and view angle. A measurement that does not account for the real emissivity of a surface will appear “colder” than it actually is.For agricultural applications, many organic materials and materials with very rough surfaces have emissivity values approaching 1.0. For other applications, including power line and solar cell inspection, the surface might be a highly polished glass or metal, both of which can have much lower emissivity values.It is important for the thermal camera to be set to the correct emissivity or incorrect temperatures will be measured.What Is Reflectivity In Thermal ImagingReflectivity is a measure of the ability of a surface to reflect radiation. A camera close to a surface is sensing both the heat sustained from the surface temperature and the reflected background environmental temperature. It is very challenging to make temperature measurements of a highly reflective surface because the image is influenced by the background thermal reflections.In a UAS application, an unpainted and clean metal roof can appear colder than it actually is because the shiny roof reflects the sky above it. Consider the case of a stainless steel sheet on a rooftop, 0.80 reflectivity and 0.20 emissivity, a radiometric temperature measurement would be highly biased towards the reflected background temperature of the sky.

 A clear sky may have a background temperature, which is typically well below 0°C and possibly as low as -20°C. The actual sky background temperature will vary depending on atmospheric conditions and time of day.Reflective surfaces pose additional challenges in UAS applications. Reflection of the sun in the thermal image will appear as sun glints. Radiometric temperature measurements of the sun glints can be inaccurate by hundreds of degrees.It is advisable to take a sequence of images of the surface from different angles to reduce the influence of any single sun glint. However, care must be taken to not make measurements at exceedingly oblique angles because reflectivity degrades based on view angle.Alternatively, a very close range and straight on measurements can result in the camera viewing a reflection of itself and result in inaccurate measurements.Much like emissivity, the reflectivity of a surface is highly dependent on the surface morphology and roughness.Since reflectivity (R) is related to emissivity (E) by R = 1-E, the importance of reflectivity can be greatly reduced by making measurements of surfaces with very high emissivity, ideally greater than 0.90.For UAS measurements of controlled surfaces, such as a steel tank on a rooftop, high emissivity/low reflectivity matte-flat black paint can be used to make “measurement patches” that result in highly reproducible measurements.What Can Heat Vision Cameras Capture? Thermal energy is radiated off nearly every source on our planet and in our Universe.  Heat vision cameras can capture images and differences in heat emitted from the following;Living Species – People, animals and vegetation.Buildings – Skyscrapers, buildings, factories, houses and tents.Machinery – engines, conveyor belts and assembly lines.Planes, Boats and Vehicles – all types of automobiles, boats and vehiclesElectrical – circuits, power lines, capacitor, coupling capacitor and insulation etc.Land, rocks and buoys – These absorb heat from the sun during the day and radiate it off during the night.Liquids and gas – these all emit thermal radiation and detected by heat vision cameras.Because different materials absorb and radiate thermal radiation at different rates, an area which we believe has only one temperature will have many subtly different temperatures.  For example, looking at a person through a heat vision camera will show that our bodies have small temperature differences from one area to another.A heat vision camera detects these temperature differences and translates them into image detail.

 Heat Vision Cameras In Dust, Smoke Fog And  RainDust and Smoke – The mining industry are big users of thermal cameras.  In a mining environment, if visible light or digital cameras are used for monitoring, they will miss out on any potential defects as mining environments are often very dusty. Thermal can see through dust and smoke due to their infrared wavelength, meaning that it is able to detect any heat energy through most environmental conditions.Fog and Rain – Although thermal imaging cameras can see in total darkness, through light fog, light rain and snow, the distance they can see is affected by atmospheric conditions.A thermal imaging camera produces an image based on the differences in thermal radiation that an object emits. The further this infrared signal has to travel from the target to the thermal camera, the more of that signal can be lost along the way.Fog and rain can severely limit the range of a thermal imaging system due to scattering of light off droplets of water. The higher the density of droplets, the more the infrared signal is diminished.To capture images in fog and rain, the higher end thermal vision cameras work best.Heat Vision Cameras – Easy To UseWhile the scientific details of how thermal imaging works is quite complex, the reality is that modern thermal cameras are extremely easy to use. The images are very clear and easy to understand, requiring little training or interpretation.Note: For mechanical and electrical uses, heat vision cameras should always be operated by qualified engineers who understand the thermal radiation spectrum of the equipment or material being imaged.Reflected Light Vision CamerasThermal imaging cameras only require heat from an object to be able to capture the image or video of a scene.  Very closely related and sometimes confused are night vision and infrared illuminated cameras.  Let’s take a quick look at night vision and infrared illuminated cameras.Thermal Vision Cameras vs Infrared Illuminated Cameras Infrared illuminated cameras generate their own reflected light by projecting a beam of near-infrared energy which it’s imager can then see when it bounces back from the object.This works very well, however infrared illuminated cameras still rely on reflected light to make the image.  They have the same limitations as other night vision cameras which depend on reflected light energy, which is generally short in range and has poor contrast.Thermal Vision Cameras vs Night Vision Cameras / GogglesNight images or video which are greenish in color come from night vision cameras or goggles. Night Vision Goggles or NVGs take in small amounts of visible light, magnify it and project it on to a display.Cameras made from NVG technology have limitations.  If there isn’t enough visible light available, they can’t see well. The imaging performance of anything, which rely on reflected light is limited by the amount and strength of the light being reflected. In other words, they won’t see anything in total darkness.Also night vision goggles and other low light cameras are not very useful during twilight hours.  There is too much light for the NVG goggles to work effectively, but not enough light to see with the naked eye.Thermal cameras aren’t affected by visible light, so they can give you clear pictures even when you are looking into the setting sun. In fact, with a quality heat vision camera you could aim a spotlight at the thermal camera lens and still get a perfect picture.How Far Can Heat Vision Cameras See?The distance or range from a thermal vision camera you can see is highly dependent on a number of camera variables such as;What is the lens of the thermal vision camera?Is the camera equipped with a cooled or uncooled detector?What is the sensitivity?What is the size of the object?What is the temperature of the target and the background?By answering these questions, you can then choose the correct thermal imaging camera for the work to be completed.Before we move onto the best heat vision cameras for drones, here is an excellent video which explains very nicely how infrared thermal imaging works.10 Thermal Imaging Cameras For DronesDrones with a mounted heat vision camera has many great uses is covered a bit further down.

 Solar Farm Inspections – Drones with thermal cameras can scan large solar panel installations in a few minutes allowing the operator to isolate and measure potential problem areas with a single aerial view.  Solar farm inspections are almost impossible from the ground.Construction Site And Roofing Inspections – Before drones, building and roofing inspections took a long time and has been a major source of workplace accidents over the years. Roof inspections and other building surveys with a thermal camera equipped drone will take just minutes saving time and lives.One of the leading providers of drones for roofing inspections is Kespry.Kespry’s thermal inspection solution is based on radiometric temperature analysis, providing actionable data to people inspecting roofs. Radiometric analysis means that a specific temperature is displayed for a specific point on a roof. In contrast, non-radiometric thermal drone data simply shows general temperature differences and changes in an area, making it hard to determine whether there is a specific point of damage or concern.Fire Fighting – Particularly valuable for firefighting, drones with heat vision cameras give Incident Commanders the ability to see through smoke and keep track of their personnel in large fire scenes.  Fire crews will know exactly where the fire is hottest and when the fire looks to be out, a thermal equipped drone will be able to give definite confirmation of the heat been dissipated from the scene.Search And Rescue – A drone with thermal camera is a must have piece of equipment for rescuers. The thermal camera can be used both in day and night rescue missions.  Drones can view and cover hundreds of acres in minutes.In daytime, the thermal radiation from a missing person on a mountain will stand out much more than the image from an ordinary standard video camera.  A person may be wearing the same color clothing as their surrounding making it difficult for a standard video camera to detect the missing person.Mining – In the case of coal mining, often coal is stored in vast quantities in large storage containers. This can lead to high risk of a fire. It is very important to carrying out temperature monitoring of these coal containers as self-ignition can easily take place.Other mining operations have large conveyor belts, a drone with thermal camera is the quickest way to monitor the health of the equipment.  When equipment is stressed, it will show up hotter on a thermal image than previous.Thermal imaging can help detect equipment which is under stress and at some point will break.To finish off this post, here is an excellent video which shows you practical examples of how thermal imaging works, it’s color spectrum from the software and all the great applications for thermal cameras.Share this article Quick Drone Parts Overview Along With Handy DIY Tips12 Best Photogrammetry Software For 3D Mapping Using Drones Search DroneZon
