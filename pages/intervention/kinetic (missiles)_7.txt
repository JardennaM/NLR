 Drones Used Missiles With Knife Warhead To Take Out Single Terrorist Targets  (arstechnica.com)

Zorro shares a report from The Wall Street Journal: The U.S. government has developed a specially designed, secret missile for pinpoint airstrikes that kill terrorist leaders with no explosion (Warning: source paywalled; alternative source), drastically reducing damage and minimizing the chances of civilian casualties. Both the Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon have used the weapon while closely guarding its existence. A modified version of the well-known Hellfire missile, the weapon carries an inert warhead. Instead of exploding, it is designed to plunge more than 100 pounds of metal through the tops of cars and buildings to kill its target without harming individuals and property close by.
 
To the targeted person, it is as if a speeding anvil fell from the sky, the officials said. But this variant of the Hellfire missile, designated as the R9X, also comes equipped with a different kind of payload: a halo of six long blades that are stowed inside and then deploy through the skin of the missile seconds before impact, shredding anything in its tracks. The R9X is known colloquially to the small community of individuals who are familiar with its use as "the flying Ginsu," for the blades that can cut through buildings or car roofs and kill the target. The nickname is a reference to the popular knives sold on TV infomercials in the late 1970s and early 1980s that showed them cutting through both tree branches and tomatoes. The weapon has also been referred to as the Ninja bomb.

Exactly.A kevlar helmet will shatter, diffusing some of the force, but the remainder will still be FAR more than enough to cave in your skull.A steel pot MAY stop penetration, but steel isn't bulletproof.  And with that much kinetic force behind it, it'll still cave the helmet (and your skull) in and kill you.And the blunt force trauma of being hit like that, even if it misses your head, should kill you instantly.  And if it hits your head, your head is moving wherever the thing decides it should go.So, as you said, in either case, your upper spinal column is toast.It'll be like someone strapped your head to a muscle car with a 1000 foot tether and had the driver floor it.Whether you want it or not, your head's going someplace.

You know, I love listening to idiots like you talk about stuff as if you are knowledgeable.

I have seen a kevlar helmet shatter. In real life, not on Call Of Duty.

Also, when 100 pounds of shit hits you at the speed that a hellfire travels, you are dead. It doesn't matter if your head was in a impenetrable helmet (which kevlar definitely isn't), because your delta v from the momentum of the impact will turn you into a fine paste. the parts it hits anyway at least.

A steel pot helmet (What I wore in Basic training and AIT) is not better than Kevlar (what I wore in the 10th Mountain Division, Light Infantry) in this situation, you're still dead either way.... unless the impact is on some non-vital part of you and both the bleeding is stopped and your shock is treated quickly.

This doesn't really seem novel... just a large flechette round. Flechettes have been deployed either directly from the muzzle via the rounds' explosion since at least WWI.During WWI they used to spray solid steel flechettes from aircraft over areas where troops were encamped in tents.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org]

People laugh at that sort of stuff as being primitive, but some of the descriptions of what it was like to be on the receiving end of a flechette attack are pretty hair-raising. Years ago I read an account by a British WWI solder who recalled waking up in the early morning to commotion when a German Albatros Biplane flew over the camp and dropped a load of flechettes, he was roused just in time to see a flechette plummet through the top of the tent, through the torso of the guy sleeping next to him and bury itself in the ground under the poor guy's field bed. What made it worse was that sometimes the aircraft wold glide in over the camp silently early in the morning to drop the things. That was particularly nerve racking because, you could usually hear a shell make some kind of sound before it impacted and dive into a fox-hole to avoid the worst of the blast and shrapnel wave, but flechette attacks came from directly above and for marching troops there were no bunkers to hide in and often no warning of the attack.

Probably one. The thing about dogfights is that the target is actively evading and taking defensive measures. (ECM, flares, ect.) This was used on someone who was caught unawares.  Hellfire missiles are pretty good at hitting stationary targets.Also, to point out an important aspect of this weapon that everyone so far has missed: The lack of explosive payload makes it much easier to determine if the target was actually killed.

The earliest propelled missiles, the first metal cased rockets used by Tippu Sultan of Mysore kingdom of pre-colonial India against East India Company, were in fact strapped with swords.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... [wikipedia.org]They were the opposite of precision guided systems though.https://www.youtube.com/watch?... [youtube.com]Interestingly, it was these early rockets that were soon improved and repurposed by the British as Congreve rockets and were used against US in the War of 1812 and their descriptions live to this day as "rockets' red glare" in Francis Scott Key's The Star-Spangled Banner.

To be more concise, this is a kinetic energy weapon (IE it does not use explosives).  To prevent the projectile from simply punching a small 7" diameter hole through the target vehicle and passing straight through it (potentially between all the passengers, if it hits the roof in the very center, which is the aim point), additional metal fins were added to at least triple the diameter that is impacted (which pretty much means it's now going to cave in the entire roof of a normal sized car).These aren't "knives", in that they wouldn't be sharpened.  They don't need to be sharp (the missile travels at mach 1.3 - 1000 mph), and it's not desirable for them to be either (again, the idea is to cave in the roof of the entire vehicle, sending all that mass down on the passengers too, so they don't want the fins to cleanly cut through the vehicle).

Seriously, this might be a nice way to take out individuals before they are able to run away.  use a high flying preditor at say 50-60K' and have them carrying multiple small drones  that are dropped and upon getting close to the target then slows down while pinpointing a laser on target. Then simple allow small drone to impact ground or blow it up with small amount of C4.

As noble as it is to try to hold the moral high ground, have you considered what happens when one side is fighting an all-out war, and the other side refuses to acknowledge they're in a state of war?

Terrorists are not acting on behalf of a nation state. They are acting on behalf of Mohammad, a 7th century pedophile and child rapist descended from an illegitimate child of Abraham, who spread his farcical "faith" with the sword by murdering anyone who refused to accept it.I was with you until this point.  Terrorists can and in fact in some cases do operate on behalf of a nation state(state sponsored terrorism).  And terrorism incorporates more than just Islam.  There are Christian terrorists, Jewish terrorists, Buddhist terrorists, Hindu terrorists, Sikh terrorists, atheist terrorists, eco terrorists, anarchist terrorists, nationalist terrorists, right-wing terrorists, left wing terrorists, Marxist terrorists, Maoists terrorists, fascist terrorists, etc.  Just about the only belief structure, ideology, or other "ism" that doesn't have an associated terrorist group is pacifism and, given human nature, that's bound to have one eventually as well.

The pedophile thing comes from the fact that at least 3 of his wives are documented as having been around 9 at the time the marriages were consummated. This is not denied by mainstream Islamic scholars, and was fairly widespread practice at the time.Western cultures at the time were marrying off women around the age of 12, so not much better. There are extremists from both sides who would support it still being the norm.Joan, the daughter of English king Edward II was 7 years old when she was married off to the (eventual) king of the Scotts David II, who was only 4 at the time.
