 DroneCatcher A Delft Dynamics product  
  





DroneCatcher is a net gun armed multicopter. It can safely remove illicit drones from the air. After detection by, for example a radar, vision or an acoustic system, DroneCatcher is able to quickly approach hovering or moving threats. With the use of multiple onboard sensors, the net gun can be locked on the target. Due to DroneCatcher’s tracking capabilities, the drone will be swiftly caught by shooting a net. After the catch, DroneCatcher can carry the captured drone on a cable to a harmless place and release it there. If the caught drone is too heavy to be carried, it can be dropped with a parachute to ensure low impact on the ground.
Delft Dynamics B.V. is specialized in building small unmanned helicopters for stable, easy to control, aerial sensor-platforms. This is accomplished by intelligently combining computer and sensor technology.

 Making the air secure


Applications




Nowadays it is relatively easy and cheap to buy a drone. These systems have created a new way for criminals to use them for smuggling or to disturb public order and security. To counter this threat, project DroneCatcher was initiated by Delft Dynamics and is supported by the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee (Military Police), the Dutch National Police and the Dutch Ministry of Safety and Justice.
The DroneCatcher is ideal for securing:
* Airports
* Prisons
